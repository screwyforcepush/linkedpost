One of the primary hurdles is the computational cost. Training self-supervised models requires significant computational resources, which could be a constraint for many businesses. Another challenge is the quality of the learned representations. While self-supervised learning can generate useful representations, their quality can vary and may not always be optimal for the task at hand. Furthermore, the interpretability of self-supervised learning models can be challenging, making it difficult to understand why the model made a certain prediction or decision.\n\nNonetheless, these challenges are not insurmountable. Businesses can leverage cloud-based solutions to address the computational cost, providing scalable and cost-effective computational resources. To improve the quality of the learned representations, businesses can employ techniques such as contrastive learning, which motivates the model to learn more discriminative features. As for the interpretability issue, businesses can utilize explainability tools that offer insights into the model's decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, the self-supervised learning approach is a critical component that makes the Struc-Bench and Contrastive Decoding combination work.
