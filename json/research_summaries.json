It involves analysing the text or images generated by the prompts to determine their aesthetic appeal. Mark Weiser's 1993 paper on ubiquitous computing is a key reference in this field. Yutong Xie et al. (2023) and Fred Zenker and Kristopher Kyle (2021) have conducted research on prompt engineering, and Joanna Zylinska (2020) has written a book on AI art.",
            " Prompt logs are used in text-to-image generation systems to impact the quality of the generated images. Patterns and trends in the prompt logs can lead to better or worse image generation. Research has been conducted to investigate minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices, variable length video generation from open domain textual descriptions, a large-scale prompt gallery dataset for text-to-image generative models, and design guidelines for prompt engineering text-to-image generative models.",

Specific prompts or patterns in prompt logs can lead to high aesthetic appeal images.

            "The chain of thought prompting technique is a cognitive strategy that involves guiding individuals through a series of interconnected thoughts or ideas in order to stimulate their thinking process and generate new insights or perspectives. This technique is often used in brainstorming sessions, problem-solving exercises, or creative thinking activities.\n\nThe chain of thought prompting technique typically starts with a specific question or prompt, which serves as the initial link in the chain. From there, individuals are encouraged to explore related ideas or concepts, building upon each previous link in the chain. This process helps to uncover connections, associations, and potential solutions that may not have been immediately apparent.\n\nBy following the chain of thought, individuals are able to delve deeper into a topic, consider different angles, and explore various possibilities. This technique can be particularly useful in breaking through mental blocks, encouraging divergent thinking, and fostering creativity.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique is a valuable tool for stimulating and expanding one's thinking process, allowing for the generation of new ideas and insights.",
            "The chain of thought prompting technique is a reasoning process used to solve problems or answer questions. It involves breaking down the problem or question into smaller steps and logically connecting them to arrive at a solution. \n\nIn the provided examples, the chain of thought prompting technique is used to solve various problems. In the first example, the speed of a boat in still water is determined by considering the speed of the current and the time it takes for the boat to travel a certain distance. By setting up equations and solving for the unknown variable, the speed of the boat in still water is found to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the distance covered by a car in a given time is calculated by converting the speed from km/hr to meters/second and multiplying it by the time in seconds. The distance is found to be 378.89 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the location where peanut butter can be stored is determined by reasoning that food items are usually stored in places where they can stay fresh, such as a refrigerator or a pantry. The correct answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the location where the person's friend might be waiting is reasoned by considering the context of the squash court and eliminating options that do not fit. The correct answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the desired action of people who love a place they are going on vacation is reasoned by considering the options given and selecting the one that makes the most sense. The correct answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique involves logical reasoning, problem-solving, and elimination of incorrect options to arrive at the correct answer. It can be applied to various types of problems and questions.",

The correct answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the desired action of people who love a place they are going on vacation is reasoned by considering the options given and selecting the one that makes the most sense. The correct answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique involves logical reasoning, problem-solving, and elimination of incorrect options to arrive at the correct answer. It can be applied to various types of problems and questions.",

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec?

We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable steps, represented as a tree structure. Each step in the tree represents a specific line of reasoning or thought process.\n\nIn the given examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to solve various problems. For instance, in the first example, the problem is to find the speed of a boat in still water. The tree of thought starts with assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr. It then considers the current of the stream (4 km/hr) and calculates the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current. By adding these two times, the total time spent traveling is found to be 2 hours. Solving for x, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the problem is to find the distance covered by a car in 14 seconds. The tree of thought involves converting the given speed of the car (96 km/hr) to meters per second and then multiplying it by the time (14 seconds) to find the distance. The final answer is determined to be 378.89 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the problem is to determine where peanut butter can be stored. The tree of thought considers that peanut butter is a food item and is usually stored in a place where it can stay fresh, such as a refrigerator or a pantry. The final answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the problem is to figure out where the person's friend might be waiting. The tree of thought considers that the person is waiting at a squash court, which suggests they are likely at a sports facility or gym. The only option that seems plausible as being at the other end of a public place is a park. Therefore, the final answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the problem is to identify what people want to do when they love a place they are going on vacation to. The tree of thought considers the given options and concludes that the only option that makes sense is staying there. Therefore, the final answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique helps break down complex problems into smaller steps, guiding the reasoning process and facilitating problem-solving. It allows for a systematic approach to analyzing and solving problems by considering different lines of thought and reasoning.",
            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps represented as a tree structure, with each step representing a specific line of reasoning or thought process. This technique is used to solve various problems by considering different lines of thought and reasoning.\n\nIn the given examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is applied to solve different problems. Each problem is broken down into a series of logical steps, represented as a tree structure. The reasoning process is explained step by step, considering different factors and options.\n\nFor example, in the problem of finding the speed of a boat in still water, the reasoning process involves assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream. The boat's travel time downcurrent and against the current is calculated, and the total time spent is equated to 2 hours. By solving the equations, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the problem of calculating the distance covered by a car in a given time, the reasoning process involves converting the speed from km/hr to meters per second and calculating the distance using the formula distance = speed * time. The distance is determined to be 378.89 meters.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by breaking down a problem into smaller steps and considering different factors and options at each step. Each step represents a specific line of reasoning or thought process. By systematically analyzing and solving each step, the overall problem can be solved.\n\nIn summary, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a problem-solving approach that breaks down complex problems into smaller steps represented as a tree structure. It allows for systematic reasoning and consideration of different factors and options. By applying this technique, problems can be solved by analyzing and solving each step of the tree structure.",

Each problem is broken down into smaller steps, and the reasoning process is explained step by step. The technique involves identifying relevant information, making logical deductions, and considering different options to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nFor example, in the first problem about the speed of a boat in still water, the technique is applied by assuming the speed of the boat as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. The problem is then broken down into two steps: the boat traveling downcurrent and the boat traveling against the current. By solving the equations derived from these steps, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second problem about the distance covered by a car in a given time, the technique is applied by converting the given speed of the car from km/hr to meters per second and calculating the distance covered in 14 seconds. The problem is broken down into several steps involving unit conversions and calculations. The final answer is determined to be 378 meters.\n\nIn the other examples, the technique is applied in a similar manner to solve problems related to storing peanut butter, waiting at a squash court, and people's desires when they love a vacation destination.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a systematic approach that breaks down complex problems into smaller steps, allowing for logical reasoning and consideration of different factors and options. It can be applied by identifying relevant information, making logical deductions, and solving each step of the problem tree to arrive at the correct answer.",
            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable steps, represented as a tree structure. Each step or node in the tree represents a specific thought or action that needs to be taken to solve the problem.\n\nIn the given examples, the reasoning process is demonstrated through a series of steps that lead to the final answer. For example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the problem is broken down into calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current. By adding these two times and solving for the boat speed, the answer is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nTo apply the tree-of-thought prompting technique, one needs to analyze the problem and identify the key steps or thoughts required to reach a solution. These steps can then be organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with each step branching out into further sub-steps if necessary. By following this structured approach, individuals can systematically work through the problem and arrive at a solution.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be applied to various problem-solving scenarios, including mathematical calculations, logical reasoning, and decision-making processes. It helps individuals break down complex problems into simpler components, making it easier to understand and solve them. By providing a clear framework for thinking and problem-solving, this technique enhances cognitive processes and improves overall problem-solving skills."

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide the thought process and reasoning behind answering a question or solving a problem. It involves breaking down the problem into smaller components and considering different possibilities or options at each step. This technique can be used in conjunction with the chain of thought approach, which involves sequentially exploring different lines of reasoning to arrive at a solution.\n\nIn the provided examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to analyze and solve the given questions. The reasoning process involves considering relevant information and making logical deductions to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nFor example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to calculate the boat's speed. The process involves assuming the boat's speed in still water as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. By calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current, and adding them together, the total time of 2 hours is obtained. Solving for x, the boat's speed in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the second question about the distance covered by a car in a given time, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to convert the given speed from km/hr to meters per second and calculate the distance covered in 14 seconds. By converting the speed and using the formula distance = speed * time, the distance of 378.89 meters is obtained.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by systematically analyzing the given information, breaking down the problem into smaller components, and considering different possibilities or options at each step. It involves logical reasoning and calculations to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a valuable approach for problem-solving and reasoning, and when used in conjunction with the chain of thought, it can help guide the thought process and lead to accurate solutions.",

The reasoning process involves considering different factors and options to arrive at the correct answer. For example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the researcher assumes the speed of the boat as x km/hr and considers the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. By calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current, and adding them up to equal 2 hours, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the second question about the distance covered by a car in 14 seconds, the researcher converts the given speed of the car from km/hr to meters per second and calculates the distance covered using the formula distance = speed * time. The distance is found to be 378.89 meters.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by systematically analyzing the problem, considering relevant factors, and exploring different possibilities or options at each step.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to solve reasoning-based questions by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and logically connecting them. It involves analyzing the given information, identifying relevant concepts, and applying logical reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nIn the provided examples, the technique is applied to solve various reasoning-based questions. For each question, the reasoning process is outlined step by step, showing how the given information is analyzed and logically connected to arrive at the final answer.\n\nIn the first example, the question asks for the speed of a boat in still water. The given information includes the speed of the stream and the time it takes for the boat to travel a certain distance. By assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr, the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current can be calculated. By adding these two times and solving for x, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the question asks for the distance covered by a car in a certain time. The given information includes the speed of the car and the time. By converting the units of speed and time to meters and seconds, the distance covered in 14 seconds can be calculated. The final answer is determined to be 378 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the question asks where peanut butter can be stored. By analyzing the nature of peanut butter as a food item and considering where food items are usually stored, the answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the question asks where the person is waiting for their friend. By considering the context of waiting at a squash court and the options provided, the answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the question asks what people want to do when they love a place they are going on vacation to. By considering the options provided and the concept of loving a place, the answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique involves breaking down reasoning-based questions into smaller steps and logically connecting them to arrive at the correct answer.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The abstract provided does not directly discuss the topic of \"Unique ways to combine prompting techniques.\" However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to inform our understanding of the topic.\n\nFrom the abstract, we can gather that there are studies and research papers related to text-to-image generation systems, lexical diversity indices, AI art, and human-computer interaction. These topics may provide insights into different prompting techniques and their applications.\n\nTo further explore unique ways to combine prompting techniques, it would be beneficial to review the specific studies and research papers mentioned in the abstract, such as:\n\n- [56] \"A Prompt Log Analysis of Text-to-Image Generation Systems\" by Yutong Xie et al. This paper likely discusses different prompts used in text-to-image generation systems and their effectiveness in producing desired outputs.\n\n- [57] \"Investigating minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices\" by Fred Zenker and Kristopher Kyle. This paper may explore how different prompt lengths can impact the lexical diversity of generated text.\n\n- [58] \"AI Art: Machine Visions and Warped Dreams\" by Joanna Zylinska. This book may provide insights into the intersection of AI and art, including how prompts can be used to guide the creation of AI-generated art.\n\nBy delving into these specific sources, we can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and potentially identify unique ways to combine prompting techniques.",
            "The abstract provided does not directly discuss the topic of \"unique ways to combine prompting techniques.\" However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to inform our understanding of the topic.\n\nFrom the abstract, we can gather that the research is focused on text-to-image generation systems and prompt log analysis. It mentions the use of images with high aesthetic appeal and low aesthetic appeal, as well as the exploration of minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices.\n\nTo combine prompting techniques in a unique way, one approach could be to experiment with different combinations of prompts and analyze their effectiveness in generating high-quality and diverse images. This could involve using prompts that vary in length, style, or content, and evaluating the resulting images based on aesthetic appeal and diversity.\n\nThe application of this approach would involve conducting experiments with text-to-image generation systems, using a dataset of images with high and low aesthetic appeal. Different combinations of prompts would be used to generate images, and the resulting images would be evaluated using metrics such as aesthetic appeal and diversity. The analysis of the prompt log would provide insights into the effectiveness of different prompting techniques and help identify unique combinations that yield desirable results.\n\nOverall, the key points from the abstract suggest that combining prompting techniques in text-to-image generation systems can be explored through experimentation and analysis of prompt logs. The application of this approach involves conducting experiments with different combinations of prompts and evaluating the resulting images based on aesthetic appeal and diversity."

            "What can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability.\n\nObviously, sometimes users have to or want to leave the video service, but It is important to understand when this happens and if there is a trend. More importantly, it predicts at-risk users in advance, so retention campaigns can be launched.\n\nToday there are proven consolidated techniques to make churn management a mandatory activity, especially for video services based on a subscription business model.\n\nThere are solutions in the market like JUMP Retention, which are capable of tracking the distribution of users according to their likelihood of leaving the service in the coming months. The main variables that influence near-future churn probability for each user are also provided.\n\nAI can also be applied to improve content production and acquisition processes, which can then be used to create the content catalogue o\ufb00ered to the customer base or e\ufb00iciently license sport rights.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n8\n\nIn this area, the applications vary, depending on the video service provider\u2019s business model.\n\nFor those video service providers that traditionally license content from the major Hollywood studios, it is very important to forecast what type of content will be the most relevant for its customer base for one to two years ahead.\n\nShould I invest more in licenses for series or movies, in action or comedy, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, those service providers who produce their own content have to have an even longer forecast window. We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment. For example, JUMP Prediction today is already building predictive content consumption models that help with these decisions.\n\nAI applied to product development.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation: using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out.\n\nEvery detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n9\n\nAlso related to the product, o\ufb00ering a voice-enabled UX is unquestionably a growing trend in video services.\n\nWith voice commands in the video-on-demand service, viewers can now launch and control their viewing experience giving voice commands to devices that support technologies like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.\n\nAs an example, Accedo and Channel 4 have been working together to allow all Channel 4 viewers in the UK to start viewing content from All 4 simply by saying, \u201cOK Google, play Gogglebox\u201d. Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns Netflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine. For years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization. As a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation. Using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out. Every detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives proven, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nNetflix also uses AI algorithms to assess each piece of content and assign it an encoding rate based on content genre, action velocity, and many other criteria that optimize the service experience depending on factors like the device used, available connectivity, etc.\n\nThere are already Hollywood studios creating customized content. 20th Century Fox, for example, has used AI to create content such as the trailer for the sci-fi movie, Morgan.\n\nUsing trailers for one hundred horror movies, Data scientists trained an AI automatic-learning algorithm to analyze the di\ufb00erent visual composition and sounds in each scene of each trailer and it was then able to understand the di\ufb00erent mechanics per version when it came time to create content of this type.\n\nAfter the algorithm was trained, it was able to analyze the 90 minutes of the movie, Morgan, and could automatically select the most appropriate scenes to include in the trailer. This task, which today normally requires at least a month of editing, was performed in 24 hours. Just imagine the future possibilities related to the production of series and long format content!\n\n5\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAnd what about the management of video services?\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, having them learn about themselves in relation to the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n!\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\n6\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nFinal Conclusion\n\nIn short, AI is not an option. Rather, to successfully compete in an ever-increasingly competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\n\n7\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nJump joins the video industry with the explicit mission to help companies maximize ROI and optimize their business decisions using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.\n\nJump was founded in 2016 by cofounders Jer\u00f3nimo Macan\u00e1s, Jes\u00fas Herrero, and John Pater who have each been working in the TV and video industry for more than a decade.\n\nOur vision is that data and its e\ufb00ective use will be the new competitive advantage in the next phase of the video industry. Nowadays only big players like Netflix, Amazon and Google use cutting- edge data technologies to compete in the video market to retain customers and increase revenues.\n\nJump is democratizing these technologies by providing a cost-e\ufb00ective Data-as-a-Service cloud platform available to all video service market players, a platform that will see your video services jump to the next level. According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Additionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, as they learn about the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n11\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nAs an example of these type of solutions JUMP Impact can automatically suggest marketing actions based on business performance KPIs. Some examples available today are:\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n\"\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons.

To successfully compete in an ever-increasing competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI. The sooner you start down the path, the sooner you will be able to identify which areas of your business are the ripest for an investment in AI-powered processes.

We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment.

Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Netflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine. For years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization. As a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation. Using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out. Every detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives proven, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nNetflix also uses AI algorithms to assess each piece of content and assign it an encoding rate based on content genre, action velocity, and many other criteria that optimize the service experience depending on factors like the device used, available connectivity, etc.\n\nThere are already Hollywood studios creating customized content. 20th Century Fox, for example, has used AI to create content such as the trailer for the sci-fi movie, Morgan.\n\nUsing trailers for one hundred horror movies, Data scientists trained an AI automatic-learning algorithm to analyze the di\ufb00erent visual composition and sounds in each scene of each trailer and it was then able to understand the di\ufb00erent mechanics per version when it came time to create content of this type.\n\nAfter the algorithm was trained, it was able to analyze the 90 minutes of the movie, Morgan, and could automatically select the most appropriate scenes to include in the trailer. This task, which today normally requires at least a month of editing, was performed in 24 hours. Just imagine the future possibilities related to the production of series and long format content!\n\n5\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAnd what about the management of video services?\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, having them learn about themselves in relation to the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n!\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\n6\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nFinal Conclusion\n\nIn short, AI is not an option. Rather, to successfully compete in an ever-increasingly competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\n\n7\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nJump joins the video industry with the explicit mission to help companies maximize ROI and optimize their business decisions using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.\n\nJump was founded in 2016 by cofounders Jer\u00f3nimo Macan\u00e1s, Jes\u00fas Herrero, and John Pater who have each been working in the TV and video industry for more than a decade.\n\nOur vision is that data and its e\ufb00ective use will be the new competitive advantage in the next phase of the video industry.

Each sharing a common trait: creating technology that can think.\n\nIn simpler terms, the science of AI studies how to make machines or computational programs intelligent and has four main objectives:\n\n1. To automate manual production processes: automated intelligence. 2. To assist with making human-performed work fast and more e\ufb00icient: assisted intelligence. 3. To help in decision-making: augmented intelligence. 4. To automate the decision-making without human intervention: autonomous intelligence.\n\nWhat industries will be a\ufb00ected by AI?\n\nAccording to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are eight key sectors where AI will most dramatically leave its fingerprint:\n\nHealth \u2022 Automotive \u2022 Financial Services \u2022 Transportation and Logistics \u2022 Technology, Communication, and Entertainment \u2022 Retail \u2022 Energy \u2022\n\nIndustry\n\n3\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nSpecifically, the PwC report indicates that there are three high potential areas for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation. 2. Personalized content creation. 3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nHow does artificial intelligence impact video service providers?\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, etc.) by investing time and money rolling-out \u201cover- the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nAll of these players face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience.

In this context, AI becomes a critical element for a video business. We\u2019d go so far as to say that survival in this sector depends on giving AI proper consideration and implementing it accordingly.\n\n4\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine.

            "Query: What are the key findings and implications of the research on \"Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data\" by Uriel Singer et al.?\n\nThe research by Uriel Singer et al. presents a method called \"Make-A-Video\" for generating videos from textual descriptions without relying on paired text-video data. The key findings of the research are as follows:\n\n1. The Make-A-Video model utilizes a two-step process: text-to-image synthesis and image-to-video synthesis. In the first step, the model generates a sequence of images based on the input text description using a text-to-image synthesis model. In the second step, the generated images are transformed into a video using an image-to-video synthesis model.\n\n2. The researchers propose a novel training approach called \"self-supervised training\" to train the Make-A-Video model. This approach leverages the temporal coherence of videos to create a self-supervised learning signal, allowing the model to learn to generate videos without the need for paired text-video data.\n\n3. The Make-A-Video model achieves competitive performance compared to existing text-to-video generation methods that rely on paired data. The generated videos exhibit coherent and meaningful visual content that aligns with the input text descriptions.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant:\n\n1. The Make-A-Video model enables video generation from textual descriptions without the need for large-scale paired text-video datasets. This reduces the data collection and annotation efforts required for training text-to-video generation models.\n\n2. The self-supervised training approach used in the Make-A-Video model can be applied to other text-to-video generation tasks, potentially expanding the applicability of text-to-video generation methods to various domains and scenarios.\n\n3. The research highlights the potential of leveraging temporal coherence in videos as a learning signal for training text-to-video generation models. This opens up new avenues for exploring self-supervised learning techniques in the field of text-to-video synthesis.\n\nIn summary, the research on \"Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data\" by Uriel Singer et al. introduces the Make-A-Video model, which can generate videos from textual descriptions without relying on paired text-video data. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of self-supervised training and highlights the potential implications of the proposed approach in the field of text-to-video synthesis.",

Therefore, without additional information or context, it is not possible to summarize the key points or provide specifics about how an AI prompting strategy works or how it can be executed.",
            "Prompts are used in AI to guide the generation of text-to-image or text-to-video systems. The abstract mentions a study on prompt log analysis of text-to-image generation systems. The study explores the use of prompts in generating images with high aesthetic appeal. The specific prompts used in the study include descriptions related to matte painting, Studio Ghibli, and trending art topics. These prompts are used to guide the AI system in generating visually appealing images.\n\nThe application of prompts in AI involves providing specific textual descriptions or instructions to guide the generation process. In the case of text-to-image systems, prompts can be used to specify the desired visual elements, styles, or themes of the generated images. The AI system then uses these prompts to generate images that align with the given instructions.\n\nTo execute the application of prompts in AI, researchers and developers need to design and train models that can understand and interpret the prompts effectively. This requires training the models on large-scale datasets that include both textual descriptions and corresponding images or videos. The models can then learn to generate visual content based on the provided prompts.\n\nOverall, prompts play a crucial role in guiding AI systems to generate specific visual content based on textual instructions. They enable the customization and control of the generated output, allowing users to specify their desired visual elements or styles."

According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Additionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, as they learn about the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n11\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nAs an example of these type of solutions JUMP Impact can automatically suggest marketing actions based on business performance KPIs. Some examples available today are:\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n\"\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nThera are many other use cases available today that you wouldn\u2019t have imagined were AI-powered, and that can certainly be useful in helping you e\ufb00ectively manage your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n12\n\nFinal Conclusions\n\nIn short, AI is not an option; it\u2019s a must. To successfully compete in an ever-increasing competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI. The sooner you start down the path, the sooner you will be able to identify which areas of your business are the ripest for an investment in AI-powered processes. You will then start to see the positive impact on your business.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nDon\u2019t wait.

            "Chain of Thought prompting is a technique used in language models to enable complex reasoning and improve their performance. It involves providing a series of prompts or questions to guide the model's thinking process and help it arrive at the correct answer.\n\nThe application of Chain of Thought prompting can be executed by following a step-by-step reasoning process. The model is presented with a question or problem, and it uses the provided prompts to break down the problem into smaller steps. It then reasons through each step, considering relevant information and making logical deductions. By following this chain of thought, the model is able to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nThe effectiveness of Chain of Thought prompting has been demonstrated in various studies. For example, in the paper by Zhuosheng Zhang et al., the authors propose a multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning approach that combines text and image inputs to improve language models' performance. Another study by Denny Zhou et al. explores the use of least-to-most prompting, where the model is initially provided with simpler prompts and gradually guided towards more complex reasoning.\n\nAdditional information provided in the context section includes tables and figures showing the batch sizes and accuracy of different datasets under various prompting conditions. These results demonstrate the impact of different prompting strategies, such as Correct-CoT, Wrong-CoT, Deep-CoT, and Shallow-CoT, on the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, Chain of Thought prompting is a technique used in language models to guide their reasoning process and improve their performance. It involves providing prompts or questions to guide the model's thinking and help it arrive at the correct answer. The application of Chain of Thought prompting involves following a step-by-step reasoning process. Various studies have explored different prompting strategies and demonstrated their effectiveness in improving language models' performance."

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Choices: A.container B.supermarket C.pantry D.sandwich E.jar A: Reasoning process: 1. Peanut butter is a food item. 2. Food items are usually stored in a place where they can stay fresh, like a refrigerator or a pantry. 3. A pantry is a good option for storing food items that don\u2019t need to be refrigerated, like peanut butter.

Choices: A.pleasant thoughts B.overspending C.moving there D.staying there E.debt A: Reasoning process: 1. People want to do something when they love a place that they are going on vacation in. 2. The options given are A. pleasant thoughts, B. overspending, C. moving there, D. staying there, and E. debt. 3. Out of these options, the only one that makes sense as something people might want to do when they love a place is D. staying there. Final answer: D. Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.
