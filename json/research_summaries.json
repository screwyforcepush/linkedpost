It involves analysing the text or images generated by the prompts to determine their aesthetic appeal. Mark Weiser's 1993 paper on ubiquitous computing is a key reference in this field. Yutong Xie et al. (2023) and Fred Zenker and Kristopher Kyle (2021) have conducted research on prompt engineering, and Joanna Zylinska (2020) has written a book on AI art.",
            " Prompt logs are used in text-to-image generation systems to impact the quality of the generated images. Patterns and trends in the prompt logs can lead to better or worse image generation. Research has been conducted to investigate minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices, variable length video generation from open domain textual descriptions, a large-scale prompt gallery dataset for text-to-image generative models, and design guidelines for prompt engineering text-to-image generative models.",

Specific prompts or patterns in prompt logs can lead to high aesthetic appeal images.

            "The chain of thought prompting technique is a cognitive strategy that involves guiding individuals through a series of interconnected thoughts or ideas in order to stimulate their thinking process and generate new insights or perspectives. This technique is often used in brainstorming sessions, problem-solving exercises, or creative thinking activities.\n\nThe chain of thought prompting technique typically starts with a specific question or prompt, which serves as the initial link in the chain. From there, individuals are encouraged to explore related ideas or concepts, building upon each previous link in the chain. This process helps to uncover connections, associations, and potential solutions that may not have been immediately apparent.\n\nBy following the chain of thought, individuals are able to delve deeper into a topic, consider different angles, and explore various possibilities. This technique can be particularly useful in breaking through mental blocks, encouraging divergent thinking, and fostering creativity.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique is a valuable tool for stimulating and expanding one's thinking process, allowing for the generation of new ideas and insights.",
            "The chain of thought prompting technique is a reasoning process used to solve problems or answer questions. It involves breaking down the problem or question into smaller steps and logically connecting them to arrive at a solution. \n\nIn the provided examples, the chain of thought prompting technique is used to solve various problems. In the first example, the speed of a boat in still water is determined by considering the speed of the current and the time it takes for the boat to travel a certain distance. By setting up equations and solving for the unknown variable, the speed of the boat in still water is found to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the distance covered by a car in a given time is calculated by converting the speed from km/hr to meters/second and multiplying it by the time in seconds. The distance is found to be 378.89 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the location where peanut butter can be stored is determined by reasoning that food items are usually stored in places where they can stay fresh, such as a refrigerator or a pantry. The correct answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the location where the person's friend might be waiting is reasoned by considering the context of the squash court and eliminating options that do not fit. The correct answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the desired action of people who love a place they are going on vacation is reasoned by considering the options given and selecting the one that makes the most sense. The correct answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique involves logical reasoning, problem-solving, and elimination of incorrect options to arrive at the correct answer. It can be applied to various types of problems and questions.",

The correct answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the desired action of people who love a place they are going on vacation is reasoned by considering the options given and selecting the one that makes the most sense. The correct answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique involves logical reasoning, problem-solving, and elimination of incorrect options to arrive at the correct answer. It can be applied to various types of problems and questions.",

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec?

We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable steps, represented as a tree structure. Each step in the tree represents a specific line of reasoning or thought process.\n\nIn the given examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to solve various problems. For instance, in the first example, the problem is to find the speed of a boat in still water. The tree of thought starts with assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr. It then considers the current of the stream (4 km/hr) and calculates the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current. By adding these two times, the total time spent traveling is found to be 2 hours. Solving for x, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the problem is to find the distance covered by a car in 14 seconds. The tree of thought involves converting the given speed of the car (96 km/hr) to meters per second and then multiplying it by the time (14 seconds) to find the distance. The final answer is determined to be 378.89 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the problem is to determine where peanut butter can be stored. The tree of thought considers that peanut butter is a food item and is usually stored in a place where it can stay fresh, such as a refrigerator or a pantry. The final answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the problem is to figure out where the person's friend might be waiting. The tree of thought considers that the person is waiting at a squash court, which suggests they are likely at a sports facility or gym. The only option that seems plausible as being at the other end of a public place is a park. Therefore, the final answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the problem is to identify what people want to do when they love a place they are going on vacation to. The tree of thought considers the given options and concludes that the only option that makes sense is staying there. Therefore, the final answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique helps break down complex problems into smaller steps, guiding the reasoning process and facilitating problem-solving. It allows for a systematic approach to analyzing and solving problems by considering different lines of thought and reasoning.",
            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps represented as a tree structure, with each step representing a specific line of reasoning or thought process. This technique is used to solve various problems by considering different lines of thought and reasoning.\n\nIn the given examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is applied to solve different problems. Each problem is broken down into a series of logical steps, represented as a tree structure. The reasoning process is explained step by step, considering different factors and options.\n\nFor example, in the problem of finding the speed of a boat in still water, the reasoning process involves assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream. The boat's travel time downcurrent and against the current is calculated, and the total time spent is equated to 2 hours. By solving the equations, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the problem of calculating the distance covered by a car in a given time, the reasoning process involves converting the speed from km/hr to meters per second and calculating the distance using the formula distance = speed * time. The distance is determined to be 378.89 meters.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by breaking down a problem into smaller steps and considering different factors and options at each step. Each step represents a specific line of reasoning or thought process. By systematically analyzing and solving each step, the overall problem can be solved.\n\nIn summary, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a problem-solving approach that breaks down complex problems into smaller steps represented as a tree structure. It allows for systematic reasoning and consideration of different factors and options. By applying this technique, problems can be solved by analyzing and solving each step of the tree structure.",

Each problem is broken down into smaller steps, and the reasoning process is explained step by step. The technique involves identifying relevant information, making logical deductions, and considering different options to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nFor example, in the first problem about the speed of a boat in still water, the technique is applied by assuming the speed of the boat as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. The problem is then broken down into two steps: the boat traveling downcurrent and the boat traveling against the current. By solving the equations derived from these steps, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second problem about the distance covered by a car in a given time, the technique is applied by converting the given speed of the car from km/hr to meters per second and calculating the distance covered in 14 seconds. The problem is broken down into several steps involving unit conversions and calculations. The final answer is determined to be 378 meters.\n\nIn the other examples, the technique is applied in a similar manner to solve problems related to storing peanut butter, waiting at a squash court, and people's desires when they love a vacation destination.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a systematic approach that breaks down complex problems into smaller steps, allowing for logical reasoning and consideration of different factors and options. It can be applied by identifying relevant information, making logical deductions, and solving each step of the problem tree to arrive at the correct answer.",
            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable steps, represented as a tree structure. Each step or node in the tree represents a specific thought or action that needs to be taken to solve the problem.\n\nIn the given examples, the reasoning process is demonstrated through a series of steps that lead to the final answer. For example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the problem is broken down into calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current. By adding these two times and solving for the boat speed, the answer is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nTo apply the tree-of-thought prompting technique, one needs to analyze the problem and identify the key steps or thoughts required to reach a solution. These steps can then be organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with each step branching out into further sub-steps if necessary. By following this structured approach, individuals can systematically work through the problem and arrive at a solution.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be applied to various problem-solving scenarios, including mathematical calculations, logical reasoning, and decision-making processes. It helps individuals break down complex problems into simpler components, making it easier to understand and solve them. By providing a clear framework for thinking and problem-solving, this technique enhances cognitive processes and improves overall problem-solving skills."

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide the thought process and reasoning behind answering a question or solving a problem. It involves breaking down the problem into smaller components and considering different possibilities or options at each step. This technique can be used in conjunction with the chain of thought approach, which involves sequentially exploring different lines of reasoning to arrive at a solution.\n\nIn the provided examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to analyze and solve the given questions. The reasoning process involves considering relevant information and making logical deductions to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nFor example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to calculate the boat's speed. The process involves assuming the boat's speed in still water as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. By calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current, and adding them together, the total time of 2 hours is obtained. Solving for x, the boat's speed in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the second question about the distance covered by a car in a given time, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to convert the given speed from km/hr to meters per second and calculate the distance covered in 14 seconds. By converting the speed and using the formula distance = speed * time, the distance of 378.89 meters is obtained.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by systematically analyzing the given information, breaking down the problem into smaller components, and considering different possibilities or options at each step. It involves logical reasoning and calculations to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a valuable approach for problem-solving and reasoning, and when used in conjunction with the chain of thought, it can help guide the thought process and lead to accurate solutions.",

The reasoning process involves considering different factors and options to arrive at the correct answer. For example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the researcher assumes the speed of the boat as x km/hr and considers the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. By calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current, and adding them up to equal 2 hours, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the second question about the distance covered by a car in 14 seconds, the researcher converts the given speed of the car from km/hr to meters per second and calculates the distance covered using the formula distance = speed * time. The distance is found to be 378.89 meters.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by systematically analyzing the problem, considering relevant factors, and exploring different possibilities or options at each step.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to solve reasoning-based questions by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and logically connecting them. It involves analyzing the given information, identifying relevant concepts, and applying logical reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nIn the provided examples, the technique is applied to solve various reasoning-based questions. For each question, the reasoning process is outlined step by step, showing how the given information is analyzed and logically connected to arrive at the final answer.\n\nIn the first example, the question asks for the speed of a boat in still water. The given information includes the speed of the stream and the time it takes for the boat to travel a certain distance. By assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr, the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current can be calculated. By adding these two times and solving for x, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the question asks for the distance covered by a car in a certain time. The given information includes the speed of the car and the time. By converting the units of speed and time to meters and seconds, the distance covered in 14 seconds can be calculated. The final answer is determined to be 378 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the question asks where peanut butter can be stored. By analyzing the nature of peanut butter as a food item and considering where food items are usually stored, the answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the question asks where the person is waiting for their friend. By considering the context of waiting at a squash court and the options provided, the answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the question asks what people want to do when they love a place they are going on vacation to. By considering the options provided and the concept of loving a place, the answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique involves breaking down reasoning-based questions into smaller steps and logically connecting them to arrive at the correct answer.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The abstract provided does not directly discuss the topic of \"Unique ways to combine prompting techniques.\" However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to inform our understanding of the topic.\n\nFrom the abstract, we can gather that there are studies and research papers related to text-to-image generation systems, lexical diversity indices, AI art, and human-computer interaction. These topics may provide insights into different prompting techniques and their applications.\n\nTo further explore unique ways to combine prompting techniques, it would be beneficial to review the specific studies and research papers mentioned in the abstract, such as:\n\n- [56] \"A Prompt Log Analysis of Text-to-Image Generation Systems\" by Yutong Xie et al. This paper likely discusses different prompts used in text-to-image generation systems and their effectiveness in producing desired outputs.\n\n- [57] \"Investigating minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices\" by Fred Zenker and Kristopher Kyle. This paper may explore how different prompt lengths can impact the lexical diversity of generated text.\n\n- [58] \"AI Art: Machine Visions and Warped Dreams\" by Joanna Zylinska. This book may provide insights into the intersection of AI and art, including how prompts can be used to guide the creation of AI-generated art.\n\nBy delving into these specific sources, we can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and potentially identify unique ways to combine prompting techniques.",
            "The abstract provided does not directly discuss the topic of \"unique ways to combine prompting techniques.\" However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to inform our understanding of the topic.\n\nFrom the abstract, we can gather that the research is focused on text-to-image generation systems and prompt log analysis. It mentions the use of images with high aesthetic appeal and low aesthetic appeal, as well as the exploration of minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices.\n\nTo combine prompting techniques in a unique way, one approach could be to experiment with different combinations of prompts and analyze their effectiveness in generating high-quality and diverse images. This could involve using prompts that vary in length, style, or content, and evaluating the resulting images based on aesthetic appeal and diversity.\n\nThe application of this approach would involve conducting experiments with text-to-image generation systems, using a dataset of images with high and low aesthetic appeal. Different combinations of prompts would be used to generate images, and the resulting images would be evaluated using metrics such as aesthetic appeal and diversity. The analysis of the prompt log would provide insights into the effectiveness of different prompting techniques and help identify unique combinations that yield desirable results.\n\nOverall, the key points from the abstract suggest that combining prompting techniques in text-to-image generation systems can be explored through experimentation and analysis of prompt logs. The application of this approach involves conducting experiments with different combinations of prompts and evaluating the resulting images based on aesthetic appeal and diversity."

            "What can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability.\n\nObviously, sometimes users have to or want to leave the video service, but It is important to understand when this happens and if there is a trend. More importantly, it predicts at-risk users in advance, so retention campaigns can be launched.\n\nToday there are proven consolidated techniques to make churn management a mandatory activity, especially for video services based on a subscription business model.\n\nThere are solutions in the market like JUMP Retention, which are capable of tracking the distribution of users according to their likelihood of leaving the service in the coming months. The main variables that influence near-future churn probability for each user are also provided.\n\nAI can also be applied to improve content production and acquisition processes, which can then be used to create the content catalogue o\ufb00ered to the customer base or e\ufb00iciently license sport rights.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n8\n\nIn this area, the applications vary, depending on the video service provider\u2019s business model.\n\nFor those video service providers that traditionally license content from the major Hollywood studios, it is very important to forecast what type of content will be the most relevant for its customer base for one to two years ahead.\n\nShould I invest more in licenses for series or movies, in action or comedy, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, those service providers who produce their own content have to have an even longer forecast window. We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment. For example, JUMP Prediction today is already building predictive content consumption models that help with these decisions.\n\nAI applied to product development.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation: using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out.\n\nEvery detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n9\n\nAlso related to the product, o\ufb00ering a voice-enabled UX is unquestionably a growing trend in video services.\n\nWith voice commands in the video-on-demand service, viewers can now launch and control their viewing experience giving voice commands to devices that support technologies like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.\n\nAs an example, Accedo and Channel 4 have been working together to allow all Channel 4 viewers in the UK to start viewing content from All 4 simply by saying, \u201cOK Google, play Gogglebox\u201d. Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns Netflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine. For years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization. As a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation. Using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out. Every detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives proven, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nNetflix also uses AI algorithms to assess each piece of content and assign it an encoding rate based on content genre, action velocity, and many other criteria that optimize the service experience depending on factors like the device used, available connectivity, etc.\n\nThere are already Hollywood studios creating customized content. 20th Century Fox, for example, has used AI to create content such as the trailer for the sci-fi movie, Morgan.\n\nUsing trailers for one hundred horror movies, Data scientists trained an AI automatic-learning algorithm to analyze the di\ufb00erent visual composition and sounds in each scene of each trailer and it was then able to understand the di\ufb00erent mechanics per version when it came time to create content of this type.\n\nAfter the algorithm was trained, it was able to analyze the 90 minutes of the movie, Morgan, and could automatically select the most appropriate scenes to include in the trailer. This task, which today normally requires at least a month of editing, was performed in 24 hours. Just imagine the future possibilities related to the production of series and long format content!\n\n5\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAnd what about the management of video services?\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, having them learn about themselves in relation to the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n!\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\n6\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nFinal Conclusion\n\nIn short, AI is not an option. Rather, to successfully compete in an ever-increasingly competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\n\n7\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nJump joins the video industry with the explicit mission to help companies maximize ROI and optimize their business decisions using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.\n\nJump was founded in 2016 by cofounders Jer\u00f3nimo Macan\u00e1s, Jes\u00fas Herrero, and John Pater who have each been working in the TV and video industry for more than a decade.\n\nOur vision is that data and its e\ufb00ective use will be the new competitive advantage in the next phase of the video industry. Nowadays only big players like Netflix, Amazon and Google use cutting- edge data technologies to compete in the video market to retain customers and increase revenues.\n\nJump is democratizing these technologies by providing a cost-e\ufb00ective Data-as-a-Service cloud platform available to all video service market players, a platform that will see your video services jump to the next level. According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Additionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, as they learn about the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n11\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nAs an example of these type of solutions JUMP Impact can automatically suggest marketing actions based on business performance KPIs. Some examples available today are:\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n\"\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons.

To successfully compete in an ever-increasing competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI. The sooner you start down the path, the sooner you will be able to identify which areas of your business are the ripest for an investment in AI-powered processes.

We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment.

Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Netflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine. For years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization. As a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation. Using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out. Every detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives proven, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nNetflix also uses AI algorithms to assess each piece of content and assign it an encoding rate based on content genre, action velocity, and many other criteria that optimize the service experience depending on factors like the device used, available connectivity, etc.\n\nThere are already Hollywood studios creating customized content. 20th Century Fox, for example, has used AI to create content such as the trailer for the sci-fi movie, Morgan.\n\nUsing trailers for one hundred horror movies, Data scientists trained an AI automatic-learning algorithm to analyze the di\ufb00erent visual composition and sounds in each scene of each trailer and it was then able to understand the di\ufb00erent mechanics per version when it came time to create content of this type.\n\nAfter the algorithm was trained, it was able to analyze the 90 minutes of the movie, Morgan, and could automatically select the most appropriate scenes to include in the trailer. This task, which today normally requires at least a month of editing, was performed in 24 hours. Just imagine the future possibilities related to the production of series and long format content!\n\n5\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAnd what about the management of video services?\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, having them learn about themselves in relation to the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n!\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\n6\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nFinal Conclusion\n\nIn short, AI is not an option. Rather, to successfully compete in an ever-increasingly competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\n\n7\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nJump joins the video industry with the explicit mission to help companies maximize ROI and optimize their business decisions using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.\n\nJump was founded in 2016 by cofounders Jer\u00f3nimo Macan\u00e1s, Jes\u00fas Herrero, and John Pater who have each been working in the TV and video industry for more than a decade.\n\nOur vision is that data and its e\ufb00ective use will be the new competitive advantage in the next phase of the video industry.

Each sharing a common trait: creating technology that can think.\n\nIn simpler terms, the science of AI studies how to make machines or computational programs intelligent and has four main objectives:\n\n1. To automate manual production processes: automated intelligence. 2. To assist with making human-performed work fast and more e\ufb00icient: assisted intelligence. 3. To help in decision-making: augmented intelligence. 4. To automate the decision-making without human intervention: autonomous intelligence.\n\nWhat industries will be a\ufb00ected by AI?\n\nAccording to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are eight key sectors where AI will most dramatically leave its fingerprint:\n\nHealth \u2022 Automotive \u2022 Financial Services \u2022 Transportation and Logistics \u2022 Technology, Communication, and Entertainment \u2022 Retail \u2022 Energy \u2022\n\nIndustry\n\n3\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nSpecifically, the PwC report indicates that there are three high potential areas for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation. 2. Personalized content creation. 3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nHow does artificial intelligence impact video service providers?\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, etc.) by investing time and money rolling-out \u201cover- the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nAll of these players face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience.

In this context, AI becomes a critical element for a video business. We\u2019d go so far as to say that survival in this sector depends on giving AI proper consideration and implementing it accordingly.\n\n4\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine.

            "Query: What are the key findings and implications of the research on \"Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data\" by Uriel Singer et al.?\n\nThe research by Uriel Singer et al. presents a method called \"Make-A-Video\" for generating videos from textual descriptions without relying on paired text-video data. The key findings of the research are as follows:\n\n1. The Make-A-Video model utilizes a two-step process: text-to-image synthesis and image-to-video synthesis. In the first step, the model generates a sequence of images based on the input text description using a text-to-image synthesis model. In the second step, the generated images are transformed into a video using an image-to-video synthesis model.\n\n2. The researchers propose a novel training approach called \"self-supervised training\" to train the Make-A-Video model. This approach leverages the temporal coherence of videos to create a self-supervised learning signal, allowing the model to learn to generate videos without the need for paired text-video data.\n\n3. The Make-A-Video model achieves competitive performance compared to existing text-to-video generation methods that rely on paired data. The generated videos exhibit coherent and meaningful visual content that aligns with the input text descriptions.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant:\n\n1. The Make-A-Video model enables video generation from textual descriptions without the need for large-scale paired text-video datasets. This reduces the data collection and annotation efforts required for training text-to-video generation models.\n\n2. The self-supervised training approach used in the Make-A-Video model can be applied to other text-to-video generation tasks, potentially expanding the applicability of text-to-video generation methods to various domains and scenarios.\n\n3. The research highlights the potential of leveraging temporal coherence in videos as a learning signal for training text-to-video generation models. This opens up new avenues for exploring self-supervised learning techniques in the field of text-to-video synthesis.\n\nIn summary, the research on \"Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data\" by Uriel Singer et al. introduces the Make-A-Video model, which can generate videos from textual descriptions without relying on paired text-video data. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of self-supervised training and highlights the potential implications of the proposed approach in the field of text-to-video synthesis.",

Therefore, without additional information or context, it is not possible to summarize the key points or provide specifics about how an AI prompting strategy works or how it can be executed.",
            "Prompts are used in AI to guide the generation of text-to-image or text-to-video systems. The abstract mentions a study on prompt log analysis of text-to-image generation systems. The study explores the use of prompts in generating images with high aesthetic appeal. The specific prompts used in the study include descriptions related to matte painting, Studio Ghibli, and trending art topics. These prompts are used to guide the AI system in generating visually appealing images.\n\nThe application of prompts in AI involves providing specific textual descriptions or instructions to guide the generation process. In the case of text-to-image systems, prompts can be used to specify the desired visual elements, styles, or themes of the generated images. The AI system then uses these prompts to generate images that align with the given instructions.\n\nTo execute the application of prompts in AI, researchers and developers need to design and train models that can understand and interpret the prompts effectively. This requires training the models on large-scale datasets that include both textual descriptions and corresponding images or videos. The models can then learn to generate visual content based on the provided prompts.\n\nOverall, prompts play a crucial role in guiding AI systems to generate specific visual content based on textual instructions. They enable the customization and control of the generated output, allowing users to specify their desired visual elements or styles."

According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Additionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, as they learn about the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n11\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nAs an example of these type of solutions JUMP Impact can automatically suggest marketing actions based on business performance KPIs. Some examples available today are:\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n\"\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nThera are many other use cases available today that you wouldn\u2019t have imagined were AI-powered, and that can certainly be useful in helping you e\ufb00ectively manage your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n12\n\nFinal Conclusions\n\nIn short, AI is not an option; it\u2019s a must. To successfully compete in an ever-increasing competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI. The sooner you start down the path, the sooner you will be able to identify which areas of your business are the ripest for an investment in AI-powered processes. You will then start to see the positive impact on your business.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nDon\u2019t wait.

            "Chain of Thought prompting is a technique used in language models to enable complex reasoning and improve their performance. It involves providing a series of prompts or questions to guide the model's thinking process and help it arrive at the correct answer.\n\nThe application of Chain of Thought prompting can be executed by following a step-by-step reasoning process. The model is presented with a question or problem, and it uses the provided prompts to break down the problem into smaller steps. It then reasons through each step, considering relevant information and making logical deductions. By following this chain of thought, the model is able to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nThe effectiveness of Chain of Thought prompting has been demonstrated in various studies. For example, in the paper by Zhuosheng Zhang et al., the authors propose a multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning approach that combines text and image inputs to improve language models' performance. Another study by Denny Zhou et al. explores the use of least-to-most prompting, where the model is initially provided with simpler prompts and gradually guided towards more complex reasoning.\n\nAdditional information provided in the context section includes tables and figures showing the batch sizes and accuracy of different datasets under various prompting conditions. These results demonstrate the impact of different prompting strategies, such as Correct-CoT, Wrong-CoT, Deep-CoT, and Shallow-CoT, on the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, Chain of Thought prompting is a technique used in language models to guide their reasoning process and improve their performance.

            "Chain of Thought prompting is a technique used in reasoning and problem-solving tasks. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller steps or thoughts, and then connecting them in a logical chain to arrive at a solution. This approach helps individuals organize their thoughts and systematically work through a problem.\n\nIn the given examples, Chain of Thought prompting is used to solve various problems. In the first example, the problem involves finding the speed of a boat in still water. The prompt breaks down the problem into smaller steps, considering the speed of the boat and the current of the stream. By calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current, the prompt arrives at the solution that the boat's speed in still water is 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the problem is to determine the distance covered by a car in a given time. The prompt converts the speed of the car from km/hr to meters/second and then calculates the distance covered in 14 seconds. The solution is found to be 378.89 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the prompt uses reasoning to determine where peanut butter can be stored. It considers that peanut butter is a food item and is usually stored in a place where it can stay fresh, such as a refrigerator or a pantry. The correct answer is identified as a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the prompt infers the location the person is waiting for their friend based on the context of a squash court. It eliminates options that do not fit the scenario and concludes that the friend might be at the other end of a public park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the prompt analyzes what people want to do when they love a place they are going on vacation to. It considers various options and concludes that staying there is the most logical choice.\n\nOverall, Chain of Thought prompting helps individuals break down complex problems, consider relevant information, and arrive at logical solutions.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Final answer: D.\n\nQ: What do people want to do when they love a place that they are going on vacation in? Choices: A.pleasant thoughts B.overspending C.moving there D.staying there E.debt A: Reasoning process: 1. People want to do something when they love a place that they are going on vacation in. 2. The options given are A. pleasant thoughts, B. overspending, C. moving there, D. staying there, and E. debt. 3. Out of these options, the only one that makes sense as something people might want to do when they love a place is D. staying there. Final answer: D. Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nWhen was the last time you did a reality check on your video marketing KPIs? If you\u2019ve been using the same benchmarks to measure success for more than a couple of years, the truth is that you\u2019re probably not getting the most out of your data.\nThe digital environment we operate in is one of constant change, driven primarily by evolving customer behaviors and expectations. This means marketers need to be on their toes, taking advantage of all the information and insights that can help them keep pace.\nWhat do customers expect? Video first. Is your team ready? Get them ready with our Video First guide.\nRead it now\nAdvancements in both available user data and a more precise understanding of what those metrics mean are helping make it possible. Amid this innovation, many common perceptions about measuring the impact of video marketing\u2014and improving it\u2014are no longer accurate.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest video marketing analytics myths to shine a light on which metrics and tools will get you the insights you need.\nMyth #1: Views are the most important metric in video marketing\nGoing viral was once upon a time seen as a golden ticket\u2014the magic moment when your brand achieved internet fame and fortune. Racking up video views was the key to making it big.\nIf that was ever truly the most valuable aspiration for a video marketer, it isn\u2019t anymore. Yes, going viral still happens, but rather than the explosive exposure it once afforded, it\u2019s more of a flash in the pan.\nReality check: Different metrics matter at different times\nVideo is a mainstay of our current digital culture. People have grown accustomed to engaging with video as entertainment, education, and part of the purchasing process.\nThat path to purchase consists of a few distinct inflection points. At each of these points, different metrics hold more weight.\nAnalytics tip: Know which metrics to watch\nWant to know what\u2019s working at each point along the path to purchase? These are the key metrics to watch for by stage.\nAwareness: While views are not the most important metric overall, there are points in time at which view totals are a valuable KPI. The awareness stage is one of those points.\nConsideration: Watch time, or engagement, is the key metric for measuring the impact your video has on viewers. Engaged audiences watch longer. If your audience is checking out at the same point in time, it might be worth recutting the video to ensure it doesn\u2019t lag and is driving quickly to what\u2019s most valuable.\nConversion: Viewing the full customer journey through touchpoint mapping can help you understand the role your video content plays in earning conversions. Interactive video is especially helpful for ROI analysis because it yields specific details about how audiences engage with your content and can drive directly to shopping carts or lead gen forms.\nRetention: Engagement data will tell you a lot about how invested customers are in your product or service. You will want to look at engagement metrics for videos that focus on training, add-ons, and upselling.\nLearn more about using metrics to measure success throughout the buyer\u2019s journey.\nMyth #2: Social media platforms provide all the analytics you need\nAh, the siren song of native video statistics, lulling marketers into believing they\u2019re sailing toward a wealth of KPIs.\nBut what are you really learning from viewing these isolated analytics? At best, you can tell how your content is performing for the audience on each specific platform, but are you really getting the full picture of reach and impact?\nReality check: Analytics viewed in isolation don\u2019t tell the whole story\nIn order to truly understand how your content performs across channels, you need to have a single view that pulls analytics from every platform where your content is published. Only then can you see how various versions of your video perform for different audiences, what works across the board, and where you\u2019re seeing the most success.\nAnalytics tip: Integrate your social data\nWhy bounce between platforms, manually extracting data and trying to make sense of it on your own, when you could simply empower a single analytics platform to do the work for you?\nBy integrating your social accounts with an enterprise-grade streaming platform, you\u2019ll be able to dig deeper into the data, do side-by-side comparisons, and discover new insights that will improve future campaign performance.\nLearn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy. BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nYou did it. You finally finished that video you\u2019ve been working on for months. Now comes the moment of truth, the moment all that hard work finally pays off. You check your video analytics: 23 views.\nWe\u2019ve all been there. As frustrating as that is, trying to get more video views can be equally aggravating. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time for a better understanding of video views.\nWhat are video views, really?\nTo product managers and engineers, video views are how many times a video is played. It means a play request was sent to the player, and the player began playing the video.\nTo marketers, video views are opportunities. They\u2019re opportunities to make potential customers aware of your brand, consider your product, and decide to shop with you. But these opportunities imply more than play requests. They assume the right audience is consuming your content.\nThe reason marketers get frustrated with video views is because that\u2019s the only metric they\u2019re tracking. Remember when pageviews used to be the primary web KPI? Marketers quickly caught on that they also needed to track metrics like bounce rate and time on page to see how their content was performing.\nTo be clear, video views aren\u2019t a bad metric. In fact, video views are fundamentally the same metric as pageviews: they both measure the number of times your content was viewed. But if you want to increase how much your content is consumed by the right people, you\u2019ll need to track other metrics.\nHow to measure video views.\nGoing viral used to be considered a legitimate marketing tactic. That is, until marketers realized that lots and lots of views from the wrong people didn\u2019t help them achieve their goals.\nTracking video views the right way means treating digital video like any other form of online content. And the same rules for measuring digital content also apply to video: you have to start at the beginning.\nMeasuring Impressions\nBefore anyone can view your content, they have to arrive at it from another channel (like clicking off an email) or within a channel (like scrolling through a social feed). When they do, that\u2019s called an impression.\nImpressions do not represent individual viewers (a single viewer can generate multiple impressions) and they do not indicate video plays or views. Whether hosted on a web page or a social post, an impression is when your video is loaded on that page or post. That\u2019s the technical definition.\nTo marketers, impressions measure how effective your video strategy is at attracting potential views. Impressions are key to tracking views because total views can only be as big as total impressions. So if you want more views, you\u2019ll need to start by getting more impressions.\nImpressions can be tracked using your CMS, the native social platform, or third-party tools like Google Analytics or HootSuite. You can also track the results of videos distributed across multiple channels in one place with platforms like Brightcove.\nMeasuring Play Rate\nAfter someone sees your video, the next step is to play it\u2014to view the content. This is where video views finally get some screen time, but even then, they\u2019re not a solo act. Play rate is the percentage of loaded videos that were actually played: total video views divided by total video impressions.\nTo marketers, play rate measures how effective your video strategy is at converting potential viewers into actual viewers. Play rate is also key to tracking views because total views are only as high as your marketing promotions are true to the video\u2019s content.\nPlay rate can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. However, not every tool automatically calculates the percentage. If you want to quickly compare videos by this metric, you\u2019ll need to export the data into a spreadsheet, build your own dashboard, or invest in a solution that does all of that for you.\nMeasuring Engagement\nTracking video views doesn\u2019t end once a viewer presses play. For a view to matter, the viewer has to consume some meaningful amount of the video\u2019s content. This is commonly referred to as engagement.\nAlso called view-through or retention rate, engagement measures how much of a video was viewed. While video views aggregate all durations (from less than a second to the entire length of the video), engagement can show you the average amount of your video that viewers watched.\nTo marketers, engagement measures how effective your video strategy is at converting actual viewers into potential or engaged customers. Engagement is key to tracking views because total views are only as valuable as the percentage of content consumed.\nEngagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number. Audience demographics.

Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Engagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number.\nHow to increase video views.\nIncreasing video views primarily depends on serving up the right content to the right audience. You wouldn\u2019t expect a video about Roth IRAs to get a lot of views among middle schoolers.\nAssuming you have the right content for the right audience, there are several tactics that can help you increase your impressions, play rate, engagement, and ultimately your video views.\nOptimizing Impressions\nVideo impressions are not unlike search impressions. Both metrics measure how much your content resonates with your audience.\nFor example, SEO marketers optimize keywords to align with the queries of their target audience. In the same way, video marketers can pick the channels that most align with the behaviors of their target audience.\nUse display and paid social for top-of-funnel content. If your goal is awareness, you want high-volume, low-intent channels so your content can reach as far as possible.\nUse paid search or organic social for mid-funnel content. If you\u2019re targeting buyers at the consideration stage, you want medium-volume, medium-intent channels. Your content needs to reach a good-sized audience interested in specific topics.\nUse email for bottom-of-funnel content. For buyers at the decision stage, you want the best low-volume, high-intent channel. Your content needs to reach an audience that knows you, likes you, and is primed to buy.\nFollowing this paradigm will help you set expectations for your video views. Decision videos will be limited by the size of your email list, but awareness videos are only limited by the size of your budget. Once you know how many views are possible, you\u2019ll know how many to aim for and be able to identify areas of improvement.\nFor example, low impressions don\u2019t always mean you\u2019re promoting in the wrong channel. It could mean your video player isn\u2019t loading properly\u2014especially if you\u2019re using a free web player. Compare your source channel\u2019s clicks against your impressions to confirm that your player is working properly.\nOptimizing Play Rate\nPlay rate is similar to email\u2019s open rate (at least it used to be\u2014thanks, Apple). Both metrics measure how well the content matches the marketing promotions.\nJust like email marketers optimize subject lines, video marketers can employ several tactics to improve the content experience.\nSet landing page videos to autoplay. Your audience already demonstrated intent to watch by clicking off of your source channel. Don\u2019t make them click again.\nTell viewers to watch the video. Vague CTAs make play buttons optional, not the next step. They also make autoplay unwelcome.\nWrite clear copy. Don\u2019t be clever. Don\u2019t be cute. Explain your video as you would to a stranger in an elevator, not a friend at the bar. This applies to the title, description, and keywords.\nCreate custom thumbnails. Never let the player decide how to promote your video. Select the still that best represents the content, and add concise copy for channels like social.\nEven with these tactics, play rate is dependent on the situation. Homepage videos compete with lots of other content for numerous audiences of varying intent. They will never achieve the play rates of landing page videos with a dedicated email audience, especially if the latter is set to autoplay.\nWithout a doubt, the wrong copy can have just as much of an effect as the wrong content. But be sure to benchmark your play rates by video location before rewriting your campaign messaging.\nOptimizing Engagement\nVideo engagement closely mirrors social engagement. Both metrics measure whether your content was consumed.\nIn a sea of competing content creators, social marketers focus on optimizing their content to be eye-catching\u2014from custom graphics to emojis to the spacing and placement of the copy itself. Video marketers share the same opportunities to ensure their content keeps and retains their audience\u2019s attention.\nTrim your intro. Whether you forgot to set your trim points or overindulged on a title screen, a long intro is a great way to lower your engagement. Your audience is busy enough being distracted by the rest of the internet, so hurry up and get to the point.\nAdd subtitles. Subtitles not only make your content more accessible, they make it more engaging. An estimated 92% of mobile users watch video with the sound off.\nConsider interactivity. Engagement can only get so high in a lean-back experience. Adding interactivity will transform passive audiences into engaged consumers. You also won\u2019t have to wait for them to take the next step. You can put it right on top of the video. Add subtitles. Subtitles not only make your content more accessible, they make it more engaging. An estimated 92% of mobile users watch video with the sound off.\nConsider interactivity. Engagement can only get so high in a lean-back experience. Adding interactivity will transform passive audiences into engaged consumers. You also won\u2019t have to wait for them to take the next step. You can put it right on top of the video.\nLike play rate, engagement is subject to a couple different factors like length and location. Shorter videos typically have higher engagement than longer videos, so be sure to benchmark your short- and long-form content. You don't want to try to compare the engagement of a 30-minute webinar against a 30-second sizzle.\nSimilarly, videos promoted on higher-intent channels tend to have higher engagement than those promoted on lower-intent channels. You may have already found that it's hard to get social media viewers to watch much more than 30 seconds. Conversely, the majority of an email audience will probably give you up to three or four minutes of their time.\nWhy you need more than video views.\nThe whole point of a video marketing strategy is to get people to watch your videos. But just trying to increase your video views will be surprisingly disappointing. You need to measure and optimize all of the metrics related to views before you see the ones that matter increase.\nDon't be intimidated by the jargon that comes with video analytics. Video is still content, and the metrics aren\u2019t any different than the rest of digital marketing. The sooner you recognize that, the sooner you'll be able to adopt the best practices you've learned from other digital channels. You may even discover advanced strategies that also apply to video marketing. The Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n3\n\nWhen you fully understand your customer\u2019s expectations, you know that there are things that they will tolerate, like a glitch in adding content to a favorites list, but missing the game because there's a problem.... this is the kind of issue viewers don\u2019t accept and may even cause them to ask for their money back or cancel their subscription, or even churn from the service, which you definitely don\u2019t want to happen. So, when we say robust, we\u2019re talking about the ability to detect problems super-fast, and also how we handle them. Sometimes the answer is not to fix, but to to mitigate, to find a way to allow that 99.999 percent to continue viewing the content through all kinds of caching mechanisms by again, using data to understand what you want to cache and how to keep the service going even when there\u2019s a hitch in your system. Another crucial aspect is the ability to update the service. Within the whole architecture of micro services, you want to be able to roll each one out separately, if you have an issue there or you want to change something. You want to build a real Cloud TV that can scale very rapidly and fix itself if there's an issue. And then of course, there's the level of the user experience, and the speed of personalization and ability to discover content: which content you promote to your customers using all kinds of techniques, pushing the right content for each segment of users. And this is again based on a lot of data research to understand what each customer wants to do, and then knowing what content to promote. So basically, scalability, reliability and automation of the different operations, using data to achieve these three goals are in summary some of the key elements that drive today's state-of-the-art cloud TV.\n\nThe Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n4\n\nTalking now from the perspective of a direct to consumer service. Which of these variables have an impact on user experience and which ones are fundamental for growth or obstacles to growth?\n\nMoving to the customer side, every project is absolutely different from the other, people are asking for different things in each project. When we think about the technology of each project, we have different targets.\n\nThe most important thing for some sports consumers may be low latency, as it relates to betting, which has been a trending topic this last year. Other viewers may not care about latency but are looking more for stability, not having to buffer; they just want to watch the football game and have it available on different devices.\n\nYour target will determine which of these features you need to build on top or sometimes in parallel because you want to reach as many carriers as possible: the people who want to watch on their TV, those who want to watch on their iPhone\u2026 and from a marketing and business perspective you can have different subscription prices to let people watch on an iPhone or tablet, for example, but not on a bigger screen, and if they do want to watch there, they would need to spend more money. So, everything is quite connected, and you need to handle this diversity or different use to build your experience, and the perfect Cloud TV platform.\n\nWhat impact would 5G have on this?\n\nFor some years now, most media businesses have been using artificial intelligence, from the very basic setup to the most complex ones that are appearing now, because the computing resources are more powerful, and we can build on that. One of the keywords here is engagement. If you want to engage your customers, you need to recommend content and be able to be as close as possible to what they want, because what you want is your customer to stay on the sofa for a long time consuming your content, but obviously don't forget that we need good content, quality content that is not all-you-can-eat content.\n\n5G will probably give us greater stability and less buffering when using cellphones, but we are also seeing improvements to latency in broadcasting. Don't forget that sometimes you build the OTT experience on top of the broadcast and linear channels, so it's quite connected.\n\nThe Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n5\n\nWhat are the main challenges that customers usually face when it comes to offering the base Cloud TV platform? From ad monetization through the passive \u201clean-back\u201d experience of FAST, to OTT apps with content curated to your audience\u2019s tastes, to premium transactional offerings and pay-per-view, the way to hook viewers into your brand will be to provide the content they want regardless of how they view it, and the experience they want when they\u2019re viewing it.\nOvercoming SVOD Obstacles\nHere\u2019s the reality: we saw clearly at IBC 2022 that media businesses are learning that they must use data-driven decisions to know which audiences to reach out to and to devise strategies to nurture longer-lasting viewer loyalty. It\u2019s now clearer than ever that this isn\u2019t just a fad or a passing trend, but for long-term growth and success, subscription media businesses need to crack the audience insights code if they want to compete.",
            "BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nYou did it. You finally finished that video you\u2019ve been working on for months. Now comes the moment of truth, the moment all that hard work finally pays off. You check your video analytics: 23 views.\nWe\u2019ve all been there. As frustrating as that is, trying to get more video views can be equally aggravating. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time for a better understanding of video views.\nWhat are video views, really?\nTo product managers and engineers, video views are how many times a video is played. It means a play request was sent to the player, and the player began playing the video.\nTo marketers, video views are opportunities. They\u2019re opportunities to make potential customers aware of your brand, consider your product, and decide to shop with you. But these opportunities imply more than play requests. They assume the right audience is consuming your content.\nThe reason marketers get frustrated with video views is because that\u2019s the only metric they\u2019re tracking. Remember when pageviews used to be the primary web KPI? Marketers quickly caught on that they also needed to track metrics like bounce rate and time on page to see how their content was performing.\nTo be clear, video views aren\u2019t a bad metric. In fact, video views are fundamentally the same metric as pageviews: they both measure the number of times your content was viewed. But if you want to increase how much your content is consumed by the right people, you\u2019ll need to track other metrics.\nHow to measure video views.\nGoing viral used to be considered a legitimate marketing tactic. That is, until marketers realized that lots and lots of views from the wrong people didn\u2019t help them achieve their goals.\nTracking video views the right way means treating digital video like any other form of online content. And the same rules for measuring digital content also apply to video: you have to start at the beginning.\nMeasuring Impressions\nBefore anyone can view your content, they have to arrive at it from another channel (like clicking off an email) or within a channel (like scrolling through a social feed). When they do, that\u2019s called an impression.\nImpressions do not represent individual viewers (a single viewer can generate multiple impressions) and they do not indicate video plays or views. Whether hosted on a web page or a social post, an impression is when your video is loaded on that page or post. That\u2019s the technical definition.\nTo marketers, impressions measure how effective your video strategy is at attracting potential views. Impressions are key to tracking views because total views can only be as big as total impressions. So if you want more views, you\u2019ll need to start by getting more impressions.\nImpressions can be tracked using your CMS, the native social platform, or third-party tools like Google Analytics or HootSuite. You can also track the results of videos distributed across multiple channels in one place with platforms like Brightcove.\nMeasuring Play Rate\nAfter someone sees your video, the next step is to play it\u2014to view the content. This is where video views finally get some screen time, but even then, they\u2019re not a solo act. Play rate is the percentage of loaded videos that were actually played: total video views divided by total video impressions.\nTo marketers, play rate measures how effective your video strategy is at converting potential viewers into actual viewers. Play rate is also key to tracking views because total views are only as high as your marketing promotions are true to the video\u2019s content.\nPlay rate can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. However, not every tool automatically calculates the percentage. If you want to quickly compare videos by this metric, you\u2019ll need to export the data into a spreadsheet, build your own dashboard, or invest in a solution that does all of that for you.\nMeasuring Engagement\nTracking video views doesn\u2019t end once a viewer presses play. For a view to matter, the viewer has to consume some meaningful amount of the video\u2019s content. This is commonly referred to as engagement.\nAlso called view-through or retention rate, engagement measures how much of a video was viewed. While video views aggregate all durations (from less than a second to the entire length of the video), engagement can show you the average amount of your video that viewers watched.\nTo marketers, engagement measures how effective your video strategy is at converting actual viewers into potential or engaged customers. Engagement is key to tracking views because total views are only as valuable as the percentage of content consumed.\nEngagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number. BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nWhen was the last time you did a reality check on your video marketing KPIs? If you\u2019ve been using the same benchmarks to measure success for more than a couple of years, the truth is that you\u2019re probably not getting the most out of your data.\nThe digital environment we operate in is one of constant change, driven primarily by evolving customer behaviors and expectations. This means marketers need to be on their toes, taking advantage of all the information and insights that can help them keep pace.\nWhat do customers expect? Video first. Is your team ready? Get them ready with our Video First guide.\nRead it now\nAdvancements in both available user data and a more precise understanding of what those metrics mean are helping make it possible. Amid this innovation, many common perceptions about measuring the impact of video marketing\u2014and improving it\u2014are no longer accurate.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest video marketing analytics myths to shine a light on which metrics and tools will get you the insights you need.\nMyth #1: Views are the most important metric in video marketing\nGoing viral was once upon a time seen as a golden ticket\u2014the magic moment when your brand achieved internet fame and fortune. Racking up video views was the key to making it big.\nIf that was ever truly the most valuable aspiration for a video marketer, it isn\u2019t anymore. Yes, going viral still happens, but rather than the explosive exposure it once afforded, it\u2019s more of a flash in the pan.\nReality check: Different metrics matter at different times\nVideo is a mainstay of our current digital culture. People have grown accustomed to engaging with video as entertainment, education, and part of the purchasing process.\nThat path to purchase consists of a few distinct inflection points. At each of these points, different metrics hold more weight.\nAnalytics tip: Know which metrics to watch\nWant to know what\u2019s working at each point along the path to purchase? These are the key metrics to watch for by stage.\nAwareness: While views are not the most important metric overall, there are points in time at which view totals are a valuable KPI. The awareness stage is one of those points.\nConsideration: Watch time, or engagement, is the key metric for measuring the impact your video has on viewers. Engaged audiences watch longer. If your audience is checking out at the same point in time, it might be worth recutting the video to ensure it doesn\u2019t lag and is driving quickly to what\u2019s most valuable.\nConversion: Viewing the full customer journey through touchpoint mapping can help you understand the role your video content plays in earning conversions. Interactive video is especially helpful for ROI analysis because it yields specific details about how audiences engage with your content and can drive directly to shopping carts or lead gen forms.\nRetention: Engagement data will tell you a lot about how invested customers are in your product or service. You will want to look at engagement metrics for videos that focus on training, add-ons, and upselling.\nLearn more about using metrics to measure success throughout the buyer\u2019s journey.\nMyth #2: Social media platforms provide all the analytics you need\nAh, the siren song of native video statistics, lulling marketers into believing they\u2019re sailing toward a wealth of KPIs.\nBut what are you really learning from viewing these isolated analytics? At best, you can tell how your content is performing for the audience on each specific platform, but are you really getting the full picture of reach and impact?\nReality check: Analytics viewed in isolation don\u2019t tell the whole story\nIn order to truly understand how your content performs across channels, you need to have a single view that pulls analytics from every platform where your content is published. Only then can you see how various versions of your video perform for different audiences, what works across the board, and where you\u2019re seeing the most success.\nAnalytics tip: Integrate your social data\nWhy bounce between platforms, manually extracting data and trying to make sense of it on your own, when you could simply empower a single analytics platform to do the work for you?\nBy integrating your social accounts with an enterprise-grade streaming platform, you\u2019ll be able to dig deeper into the data, do side-by-side comparisons, and discover new insights that will improve future campaign performance.\nLearn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy. BYSVP, Innovation and Insights at Brightcove\nBLOG / MEDIA\nEarning trust is at the core of Brightcove\u2019s efforts to grow our leadership position in the streaming technology industry. That\u2019s why we launched QoE Analytics, a suite of features focused specifically on Quality of Experience (QoE). There\u2019s no better way to build trust with our customers than helping them monitor our performance in the arena where it matters most: the viewing experience.\nWhy Monitor QoE?\nQuality of Service (QoS) and QoE are often lumped together, which can seem like a lot for many media companies to take on, both in complexity and cost. However, they are fundamentally different. QoS focuses on key network performance metrics at an operations level, while QoE provides a sense of the viewing experience from a user perspective.\nWe believe that QoE is more meaningful and often more actionable for most media companies, given the direct correlation to user satisfaction.\nWhat QoE Metrics Are Important?\nBrightcove collects a massive amount of data on behalf of our customers. This allowed us to narrow our QoE measurements down to the ones with the most significant correlations. We then cross-checked these findings with our own research team as well as several leading media companies who have studied this carefully. Based on this, we believe the following four metrics are the most important to track over time.\n1) Video start time\nVideo start time measures the average number of seconds elapsed between the play request and the stream start. High start times correlate with abandonment before streaming even starts and can indicate issues with the CDN, player plug-ins, and initial stream bitrate where intervention makes sense. Low video start times mean your audience is watching video quickly, which is what they expect.\n2) Stall Rate\nStall rate is the average number of stalls per hour, calculated by comparing total stalls to total hours viewed in the selected time range. Unlike other rebuffering events, video stalls directly affect playback. This can manifest as single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying length. Thus, a low stall rate means smoother playback and a better viewer experience.\n3) Error Rate\nError rate is the percentage of all play requests with errors preventing playback (as opposed to background errors the viewer doesn\u2019t notice). These errors typically occur before playback begins, but they can also happen during playback. Low error rates mean that customers are usually able to watch the content they select.\n4) Upscaling Time\nUpscaling time measures the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state. Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed at a lower resolution than the playback device can display, often resulting in fuzziness or pixelation. This is particularly noticeable when a lower resolution stream is played on a large-screen device. Low upscaling time generally means your viewers are enjoying smooth, crisp video playback.\nWhile upscaling time is critical in monitoring quality of experience, there are times when it may not affect the viewer. For example, upscaling often happens when high resolution content is streamed to a 4K TV but not encoded at 4K. Since most viewers won\u2019t notice this, it\u2019s important to dig into the data to determine the reasons behind low upscaling times.\nWhat Dimensions Affect QoE?\nQoE metrics can be affected by a number of different factors, from mobile app updates to content delivery network (CDN) changes. Breaking down those metrics by different dimensions makes it easy to compare performance and identify issues and opportunities.\nDevice Type\nLooking at metrics by device category allows you to see device-specific issues and trends over time. The imaginary example below shows a spike in error rate for Android devices that could be correlated to a recent app update.\nStream Type\nBy comparing the QoE metrics of VOD against livestreams, you can isolate mode-specific issues or trends. In the fictional example below, there was a jump in upscaling around a live event that resolved quickly.\nPlayer\nLooking at QOE metrics broken out by player is a great way to isolate player-specific issues. For example, there can be significant differences in load time, depending on the plugins that load at play request. There can also be issues in specific players that result in increased error rates. Seeing these differences makes them easier to isolate and act on.\nCountry\nFor customers who operate internationally, viewing QoE metrics by country can assist in isolating regional issues. Imagine a media company adopted a new content delivery network for their Asian consumers. From the example below, it\u2019s clear that the CDN underperformed when looking at the stall rate.\nQoE Analytics in Context Engagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number.\nHow to increase video views.\nIncreasing video views primarily depends on serving up the right content to the right audience. You wouldn\u2019t expect a video about Roth IRAs to get a lot of views among middle schoolers.\nAssuming you have the right content for the right audience, there are several tactics that can help you increase your impressions, play rate, engagement, and ultimately your video views.\nOptimizing Impressions\nVideo impressions are not unlike search impressions. Both metrics measure how much your content resonates with your audience.\nFor example, SEO marketers optimize keywords to align with the queries of their target audience. In the same way, video marketers can pick the channels that most align with the behaviors of their target audience.\nUse display and paid social for top-of-funnel content. If your goal is awareness, you want high-volume, low-intent channels so your content can reach as far as possible.\nUse paid search or organic social for mid-funnel content. If you\u2019re targeting buyers at the consideration stage, you want medium-volume, medium-intent channels. Your content needs to reach a good-sized audience interested in specific topics.\nUse email for bottom-of-funnel content. For buyers at the decision stage, you want the best low-volume, high-intent channel. Your content needs to reach an audience that knows you, likes you, and is primed to buy.\nFollowing this paradigm will help you set expectations for your video views. Decision videos will be limited by the size of your email list, but awareness videos are only limited by the size of your budget. Once you know how many views are possible, you\u2019ll know how many to aim for and be able to identify areas of improvement.\nFor example, low impressions don\u2019t always mean you\u2019re promoting in the wrong channel. It could mean your video player isn\u2019t loading properly\u2014especially if you\u2019re using a free web player. Compare your source channel\u2019s clicks against your impressions to confirm that your player is working properly.\nOptimizing Play Rate\nPlay rate is similar to email\u2019s open rate (at least it used to be\u2014thanks, Apple). Both metrics measure how well the content matches the marketing promotions.\nJust like email marketers optimize subject lines, video marketers can employ several tactics to improve the content experience.\nSet landing page videos to autoplay. Your audience already demonstrated intent to watch by clicking off of your source channel. Don\u2019t make them click again.\nTell viewers to watch the video. Vague CTAs make play buttons optional, not the next step. They also make autoplay unwelcome.\nWrite clear copy. Don\u2019t be clever. Don\u2019t be cute. Explain your video as you would to a stranger in an elevator, not a friend at the bar. This applies to the title, description, and keywords.\nCreate custom thumbnails. Never let the player decide how to promote your video. Select the still that best represents the content, and add concise copy for channels like social.\nEven with these tactics, play rate is dependent on the situation. Homepage videos compete with lots of other content for numerous audiences of varying intent. They will never achieve the play rates of landing page videos with a dedicated email audience, especially if the latter is set to autoplay.\nWithout a doubt, the wrong copy can have just as much of an effect as the wrong content. But be sure to benchmark your play rates by video location before rewriting your campaign messaging.\nOptimizing Engagement\nVideo engagement closely mirrors social engagement. Both metrics measure whether your content was consumed.\nIn a sea of competing content creators, social marketers focus on optimizing their content to be eye-catching\u2014from custom graphics to emojis to the spacing and placement of the copy itself. Video marketers share the same opportunities to ensure their content keeps and retains their audience\u2019s attention.\nTrim your intro. Whether you forgot to set your trim points or overindulged on a title screen, a long intro is a great way to lower your engagement. Your audience is busy enough being distracted by the rest of the internet, so hurry up and get to the point.\nAdd subtitles. Subtitles not only make your content more accessible, they make it more engaging. An estimated 92% of mobile users watch video with the sound off.\nConsider interactivity. Engagement can only get so high in a lean-back experience. Adding interactivity will transform passive audiences into engaged consumers. You also won\u2019t have to wait for them to take the next step. You can put it right on top of the video.",
            "BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nYou did it. You finally finished that video you\u2019ve been working on for months. Now comes the moment of truth, the moment all that hard work finally pays off. You check your video analytics: 23 views.\nWe\u2019ve all been there. As frustrating as that is, trying to get more video views can be equally aggravating. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time for a better understanding of video views.\nWhat are video views, really?\nTo product managers and engineers, video views are how many times a video is played. It means a play request was sent to the player, and the player began playing the video.\nTo marketers, video views are opportunities. They\u2019re opportunities to make potential customers aware of your brand, consider your product, and decide to shop with you. But these opportunities imply more than play requests. They assume the right audience is consuming your content.\nThe reason marketers get frustrated with video views is because that\u2019s the only metric they\u2019re tracking. Remember when pageviews used to be the primary web KPI? Marketers quickly caught on that they also needed to track metrics like bounce rate and time on page to see how their content was performing.\nTo be clear, video views aren\u2019t a bad metric. In fact, video views are fundamentally the same metric as pageviews: they both measure the number of times your content was viewed. But if you want to increase how much your content is consumed by the right people, you\u2019ll need to track other metrics.\nHow to measure video views.\nGoing viral used to be considered a legitimate marketing tactic. That is, until marketers realized that lots and lots of views from the wrong people didn\u2019t help them achieve their goals.\nTracking video views the right way means treating digital video like any other form of online content. And the same rules for measuring digital content also apply to video: you have to start at the beginning.\nMeasuring Impressions\nBefore anyone can view your content, they have to arrive at it from another channel (like clicking off an email) or within a channel (like scrolling through a social feed). When they do, that\u2019s called an impression.\nImpressions do not represent individual viewers (a single viewer can generate multiple impressions) and they do not indicate video plays or views. Whether hosted on a web page or a social post, an impression is when your video is loaded on that page or post. That\u2019s the technical definition.\nTo marketers, impressions measure how effective your video strategy is at attracting potential views. Impressions are key to tracking views because total views can only be as big as total impressions. So if you want more views, you\u2019ll need to start by getting more impressions.\nImpressions can be tracked using your CMS, the native social platform, or third-party tools like Google Analytics or HootSuite. You can also track the results of videos distributed across multiple channels in one place with platforms like Brightcove.\nMeasuring Play Rate\nAfter someone sees your video, the next step is to play it\u2014to view the content. This is where video views finally get some screen time, but even then, they\u2019re not a solo act. Play rate is the percentage of loaded videos that were actually played: total video views divided by total video impressions.\nTo marketers, play rate measures how effective your video strategy is at converting potential viewers into actual viewers. Play rate is also key to tracking views because total views are only as high as your marketing promotions are true to the video\u2019s content.\nPlay rate can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. However, not every tool automatically calculates the percentage. If you want to quickly compare videos by this metric, you\u2019ll need to export the data into a spreadsheet, build your own dashboard, or invest in a solution that does all of that for you.\nMeasuring Engagement\nTracking video views doesn\u2019t end once a viewer presses play. For a view to matter, the viewer has to consume some meaningful amount of the video\u2019s content. This is commonly referred to as engagement.\nAlso called view-through or retention rate, engagement measures how much of a video was viewed. While video views aggregate all durations (from less than a second to the entire length of the video), engagement can show you the average amount of your video that viewers watched.\nTo marketers, engagement measures how effective your video strategy is at converting actual viewers into potential or engaged customers. Engagement is key to tracking views because total views are only as valuable as the percentage of content consumed.\nEngagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number. BYSVP, Innovation and Insights at Brightcove\nBLOG / MEDIA\nEarning trust is at the core of Brightcove\u2019s efforts to grow our leadership position in the streaming technology industry. That\u2019s why we launched QoE Analytics, a suite of features focused specifically on Quality of Experience (QoE). There\u2019s no better way to build trust with our customers than helping them monitor our performance in the arena where it matters most: the viewing experience.\nWhy Monitor QoE?\nQuality of Service (QoS) and QoE are often lumped together, which can seem like a lot for many media companies to take on, both in complexity and cost. However, they are fundamentally different. QoS focuses on key network performance metrics at an operations level, while QoE provides a sense of the viewing experience from a user perspective.\nWe believe that QoE is more meaningful and often more actionable for most media companies, given the direct correlation to user satisfaction.\nWhat QoE Metrics Are Important?\nBrightcove collects a massive amount of data on behalf of our customers. This allowed us to narrow our QoE measurements down to the ones with the most significant correlations. We then cross-checked these findings with our own research team as well as several leading media companies who have studied this carefully. Based on this, we believe the following four metrics are the most important to track over time.\n1) Video start time\nVideo start time measures the average number of seconds elapsed between the play request and the stream start. High start times correlate with abandonment before streaming even starts and can indicate issues with the CDN, player plug-ins, and initial stream bitrate where intervention makes sense. Low video start times mean your audience is watching video quickly, which is what they expect.\n2) Stall Rate\nStall rate is the average number of stalls per hour, calculated by comparing total stalls to total hours viewed in the selected time range. Unlike other rebuffering events, video stalls directly affect playback. This can manifest as single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying length. Thus, a low stall rate means smoother playback and a better viewer experience.\n3) Error Rate\nError rate is the percentage of all play requests with errors preventing playback (as opposed to background errors the viewer doesn\u2019t notice). These errors typically occur before playback begins, but they can also happen during playback. Low error rates mean that customers are usually able to watch the content they select.\n4) Upscaling Time\nUpscaling time measures the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state. Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed at a lower resolution than the playback device can display, often resulting in fuzziness or pixelation. This is particularly noticeable when a lower resolution stream is played on a large-screen device. Low upscaling time generally means your viewers are enjoying smooth, crisp video playback.\nWhile upscaling time is critical in monitoring quality of experience, there are times when it may not affect the viewer. For example, upscaling often happens when high resolution content is streamed to a 4K TV but not encoded at 4K. Since most viewers won\u2019t notice this, it\u2019s important to dig into the data to determine the reasons behind low upscaling times.\nWhat Dimensions Affect QoE?\nQoE metrics can be affected by a number of different factors, from mobile app updates to content delivery network (CDN) changes. Breaking down those metrics by different dimensions makes it easy to compare performance and identify issues and opportunities.\nDevice Type\nLooking at metrics by device category allows you to see device-specific issues and trends over time. The imaginary example below shows a spike in error rate for Android devices that could be correlated to a recent app update.\nStream Type\nBy comparing the QoE metrics of VOD against livestreams, you can isolate mode-specific issues or trends. In the fictional example below, there was a jump in upscaling around a live event that resolved quickly.\nPlayer\nLooking at QOE metrics broken out by player is a great way to isolate player-specific issues. For example, there can be significant differences in load time, depending on the plugins that load at play request. There can also be issues in specific players that result in increased error rates. Seeing these differences makes them easier to isolate and act on.\nCountry\nFor customers who operate internationally, viewing QoE metrics by country can assist in isolating regional issues. Imagine a media company adopted a new content delivery network for their Asian consumers. From the example below, it\u2019s clear that the CDN underperformed when looking at the stall rate.\nQoE Analytics in Context BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nWhen was the last time you did a reality check on your video marketing KPIs? If you\u2019ve been using the same benchmarks to measure success for more than a couple of years, the truth is that you\u2019re probably not getting the most out of your data.\nThe digital environment we operate in is one of constant change, driven primarily by evolving customer behaviors and expectations. This means marketers need to be on their toes, taking advantage of all the information and insights that can help them keep pace.\nWhat do customers expect? Video first. Is your team ready? Get them ready with our Video First guide.\nRead it now\nAdvancements in both available user data and a more precise understanding of what those metrics mean are helping make it possible. Amid this innovation, many common perceptions about measuring the impact of video marketing\u2014and improving it\u2014are no longer accurate.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest video marketing analytics myths to shine a light on which metrics and tools will get you the insights you need.\nMyth #1: Views are the most important metric in video marketing\nGoing viral was once upon a time seen as a golden ticket\u2014the magic moment when your brand achieved internet fame and fortune. Racking up video views was the key to making it big.\nIf that was ever truly the most valuable aspiration for a video marketer, it isn\u2019t anymore. Yes, going viral still happens, but rather than the explosive exposure it once afforded, it\u2019s more of a flash in the pan.\nReality check: Different metrics matter at different times\nVideo is a mainstay of our current digital culture. People have grown accustomed to engaging with video as entertainment, education, and part of the purchasing process.\nThat path to purchase consists of a few distinct inflection points. At each of these points, different metrics hold more weight.\nAnalytics tip: Know which metrics to watch\nWant to know what\u2019s working at each point along the path to purchase? These are the key metrics to watch for by stage.\nAwareness: While views are not the most important metric overall, there are points in time at which view totals are a valuable KPI. The awareness stage is one of those points.\nConsideration: Watch time, or engagement, is the key metric for measuring the impact your video has on viewers. Engaged audiences watch longer. If your audience is checking out at the same point in time, it might be worth recutting the video to ensure it doesn\u2019t lag and is driving quickly to what\u2019s most valuable.\nConversion: Viewing the full customer journey through touchpoint mapping can help you understand the role your video content plays in earning conversions. Interactive video is especially helpful for ROI analysis because it yields specific details about how audiences engage with your content and can drive directly to shopping carts or lead gen forms.\nRetention: Engagement data will tell you a lot about how invested customers are in your product or service. You will want to look at engagement metrics for videos that focus on training, add-ons, and upselling.\nLearn more about using metrics to measure success throughout the buyer\u2019s journey.\nMyth #2: Social media platforms provide all the analytics you need\nAh, the siren song of native video statistics, lulling marketers into believing they\u2019re sailing toward a wealth of KPIs.\nBut what are you really learning from viewing these isolated analytics? At best, you can tell how your content is performing for the audience on each specific platform, but are you really getting the full picture of reach and impact?\nReality check: Analytics viewed in isolation don\u2019t tell the whole story\nIn order to truly understand how your content performs across channels, you need to have a single view that pulls analytics from every platform where your content is published. Only then can you see how various versions of your video perform for different audiences, what works across the board, and where you\u2019re seeing the most success.\nAnalytics tip: Integrate your social data\nWhy bounce between platforms, manually extracting data and trying to make sense of it on your own, when you could simply empower a single analytics platform to do the work for you?\nBy integrating your social accounts with an enterprise-grade streaming platform, you\u2019ll be able to dig deeper into the data, do side-by-side comparisons, and discover new insights that will improve future campaign performance.\nLearn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy. Learn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy.\nIt\u2019s understandable that marketers struggle with their confidence in measuring ROI. Marketing is about drawing the crowd, creating the experience, and eliciting desire for what you have to offer. Not exactly easy to measure the effectiveness of a single asset that ties directly to results. But there\u2019s good news.\nReality check: It\u2019s getting a lot easier and more straightforward\nNew technologies and integrations have opened the door to richer video marketing analytics. With machine learning and AI technology powering attribution modeling, marketers can assign sales and conversions to touchpoints in conversion paths.\nWith each new data point, we gain a better understanding of how customers discover brands, engage with content, and decide to purchase.\nAnalytics tip: Link tracked behaviors to ROI\nBy integrating your streaming platform with your CRM, you can access insights that track audience behaviors throughout the full buying process, from awareness to purchase.\nSome metrics that deliver a more accurate ROI include:\nTouchpoint mapping, which shows the number and types of videos watched at different funnel stages and sequences.\nEngagement behaviors, such as dwell times, skips, and rewatches of specific sections.\nInteractive video behaviors, including in-video navigation, poll submissions, and click-through rates from video to a landing page.\nLearn more about interactive video and ROI.\nKeep current with video marketing analytics trends\nLooking for some dependable sources to stay on top of what really matters in the fast-changing world of video marketing analytics?

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nWhen was the last time you did a reality check on your video marketing KPIs? If you\u2019ve been using the same benchmarks to measure success for more than a couple of years, the truth is that you\u2019re probably not getting the most out of your data.\nThe digital environment we operate in is one of constant change, driven primarily by evolving customer behaviors and expectations. This means marketers need to be on their toes, taking advantage of all the information and insights that can help them keep pace.\nWhat do customers expect? Video first. Is your team ready? Get them ready with our Video First guide.\nRead it now\nAdvancements in both available user data and a more precise understanding of what those metrics mean are helping make it possible. Amid this innovation, many common perceptions about measuring the impact of video marketing\u2014and improving it\u2014are no longer accurate.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest video marketing analytics myths to shine a light on which metrics and tools will get you the insights you need.\nMyth #1: Views are the most important metric in video marketing\nGoing viral was once upon a time seen as a golden ticket\u2014the magic moment when your brand achieved internet fame and fortune. Racking up video views was the key to making it big.\nIf that was ever truly the most valuable aspiration for a video marketer, it isn\u2019t anymore. Yes, going viral still happens, but rather than the explosive exposure it once afforded, it\u2019s more of a flash in the pan.\nReality check: Different metrics matter at different times\nVideo is a mainstay of our current digital culture. People have grown accustomed to engaging with video as entertainment, education, and part of the purchasing process.\nThat path to purchase consists of a few distinct inflection points. At each of these points, different metrics hold more weight.\nAnalytics tip: Know which metrics to watch\nWant to know what\u2019s working at each point along the path to purchase? These are the key metrics to watch for by stage.\nAwareness: While views are not the most important metric overall, there are points in time at which view totals are a valuable KPI. The awareness stage is one of those points.\nConsideration: Watch time, or engagement, is the key metric for measuring the impact your video has on viewers. Engaged audiences watch longer. If your audience is checking out at the same point in time, it might be worth recutting the video to ensure it doesn\u2019t lag and is driving quickly to what\u2019s most valuable.\nConversion: Viewing the full customer journey through touchpoint mapping can help you understand the role your video content plays in earning conversions. Interactive video is especially helpful for ROI analysis because it yields specific details about how audiences engage with your content and can drive directly to shopping carts or lead gen forms.\nRetention: Engagement data will tell you a lot about how invested customers are in your product or service. You will want to look at engagement metrics for videos that focus on training, add-ons, and upselling.\nLearn more about using metrics to measure success throughout the buyer\u2019s journey.\nMyth #2: Social media platforms provide all the analytics you need\nAh, the siren song of native video statistics, lulling marketers into believing they\u2019re sailing toward a wealth of KPIs.\nBut what are you really learning from viewing these isolated analytics? At best, you can tell how your content is performing for the audience on each specific platform, but are you really getting the full picture of reach and impact?\nReality check: Analytics viewed in isolation don\u2019t tell the whole story\nIn order to truly understand how your content performs across channels, you need to have a single view that pulls analytics from every platform where your content is published. Only then can you see how various versions of your video perform for different audiences, what works across the board, and where you\u2019re seeing the most success.\nAnalytics tip: Integrate your social data\nWhy bounce between platforms, manually extracting data and trying to make sense of it on your own, when you could simply empower a single analytics platform to do the work for you?\nBy integrating your social accounts with an enterprise-grade streaming platform, you\u2019ll be able to dig deeper into the data, do side-by-side comparisons, and discover new insights that will improve future campaign performance.\nLearn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy.\nEngagement Status. Just like MAPs allow you to track click rates and frequency, Engagement Status lets you track viewing rates and frequency. It\u2019s a spot check on consumption behavior and can indicate viewers primed to buy and viewers at risk of disengaging.\nAttention Index. Whereas video engagement averages completion rates, Attention Index subtracts bottom engagement from top engagement\u2014ignoring the middle. The result is a better indication of how much someone will love a video, rather than letting passive viewers influence the results.\nEntertainment Index. This is the Attention Index but for individual viewers, allowing you to see what does or doesn\u2019t engage them. Combined with Engagement Status, the Entertainment Index can track viewers as they get closer to buying or disengaging.\nWith these metrics, you can create segments based on the content your audience loves.\nFor example, with Audience Insights, you can find a shared audience that has a similar Attention Index for the same videos. Better, you can see other types of videos the shared audience watched and compare their Attention Indices.\nSo not only can Audience Insights create segments based on what your customers already love, it can predict what else they\u2019ll love.\nThe whole point of personalization is to provide the content your customers want without relying on third-party data appends that violate their privacy. While most segmentations are a step in the right direction, analyzing the results is a tedious and iterative process. Audience Insights automates the analysis, allowing you to focus on creating the best content, not figuring out what that content is.\nUsing Video to Personalize Customer Acquisition\nPersonalization doesn\u2019t have to wait till your customers are on file. Third-party platforms, like Google and social media, allow you to build lookalike campaigns by uploading lists of your customers\u2019 contact information. Those platforms then match your list with other users that share similar attributes, allowing you to serve them ads for your products.\nWhile lookalike campaigns can improve customer acquisition, they can\u2019t be truly personalized without the predictive power of Audience Insights. Like CRMs and MAPs, Audience Insights can also export lists based on customer, marketing, and content data. With powerful insights like Engagement Score and Attention Index, you can create an accurate list of potential new customers while respecting their privacy.\nCommitting to Personalization and Privacy\nSetting up your marketing stack for personalization can seem complex, but it\u2019s mostly taking many of the activities you\u2019re already doing and integrating them. Sure, you can capture tons of data and integrate your CRM with your MAP. But achieving the true personalization consumers desire happens when you\u2019ve integrated your video platform and leveraged a customer data platform.\nMarketers can expect the tools and regulations around data privacy to continue to increase. Yet they\u2019ll still be tasked with providing their audiences with personalized content, communications, and experiences they demand. Combining the right technology with the right strategy, you\u2019ll be able to offer the personalization they want and the respect for their data privacy they deserve.",

            "Engagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number.\nHow to increase video views.\nIncreasing video views primarily depends on serving up the right content to the right audience. You wouldn\u2019t expect a video about Roth IRAs to get a lot of views among middle schoolers.\nAssuming you have the right content for the right audience, there are several tactics that can help you increase your impressions, play rate, engagement, and ultimately your video views.\nOptimizing Impressions\nVideo impressions are not unlike search impressions. Both metrics measure how much your content resonates with your audience.\nFor example, SEO marketers optimize keywords to align with the queries of their target audience. In the same way, video marketers can pick the channels that most align with the behaviors of their target audience.\nUse display and paid social for top-of-funnel content. If your goal is awareness, you want high-volume, low-intent channels so your content can reach as far as possible.\nUse paid search or organic social for mid-funnel content. If you\u2019re targeting buyers at the consideration stage, you want medium-volume, medium-intent channels. Your content needs to reach a good-sized audience interested in specific topics.\nUse email for bottom-of-funnel content. For buyers at the decision stage, you want the best low-volume, high-intent channel. Your content needs to reach an audience that knows you, likes you, and is primed to buy.\nFollowing this paradigm will help you set expectations for your video views. Decision videos will be limited by the size of your email list, but awareness videos are only limited by the size of your budget. Once you know how many views are possible, you\u2019ll know how many to aim for and be able to identify areas of improvement.\nFor example, low impressions don\u2019t always mean you\u2019re promoting in the wrong channel. It could mean your video player isn\u2019t loading properly\u2014especially if you\u2019re using a free web player. Compare your source channel\u2019s clicks against your impressions to confirm that your player is working properly.\nOptimizing Play Rate\nPlay rate is similar to email\u2019s open rate (at least it used to be\u2014thanks, Apple). Both metrics measure how well the content matches the marketing promotions.\nJust like email marketers optimize subject lines, video marketers can employ several tactics to improve the content experience.\nSet landing page videos to autoplay. Your audience already demonstrated intent to watch by clicking off of your source channel. Don\u2019t make them click again.\nTell viewers to watch the video. Vague CTAs make play buttons optional, not the next step. They also make autoplay unwelcome.\nWrite clear copy. Don\u2019t be clever. Don\u2019t be cute. Explain your video as you would to a stranger in an elevator, not a friend at the bar. This applies to the title, description, and keywords.\nCreate custom thumbnails. Never let the player decide how to promote your video. Select the still that best represents the content, and add concise copy for channels like social.\nEven with these tactics, play rate is dependent on the situation. Homepage videos compete with lots of other content for numerous audiences of varying intent. They will never achieve the play rates of landing page videos with a dedicated email audience, especially if the latter is set to autoplay.\nWithout a doubt, the wrong copy can have just as much of an effect as the wrong content. But be sure to benchmark your play rates by video location before rewriting your campaign messaging.\nOptimizing Engagement\nVideo engagement closely mirrors social engagement. Both metrics measure whether your content was consumed.\nIn a sea of competing content creators, social marketers focus on optimizing their content to be eye-catching\u2014from custom graphics to emojis to the spacing and placement of the copy itself. Video marketers share the same opportunities to ensure their content keeps and retains their audience\u2019s attention.\nTrim your intro. Whether you forgot to set your trim points or overindulged on a title screen, a long intro is a great way to lower your engagement. Your audience is busy enough being distracted by the rest of the internet, so hurry up and get to the point.\nAdd subtitles. Subtitles not only make your content more accessible, they make it more engaging. An estimated 92% of mobile users watch video with the sound off.\nConsider interactivity. Engagement can only get so high in a lean-back experience. Adding interactivity will transform passive audiences into engaged consumers. You also won\u2019t have to wait for them to take the next step. You can put it right on top of the video.\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n9\n\nIf you succeed with content recommendation you can be sure that engagement levels will increase dramatically and consequently so too will the time users spend on your platform consuming content, and this in turn will lead to a greater loyalty level with your service and a higher CLTV.\n\nKnowing which content performs the best - or worst- and which content providers are the most successful can also help you optimize your investment in content.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n10\n\nThis deep understanding of your video service user\u2019s data will assist you in providing them a personalized experience. ML and AI let you offer contextual recommendations for your users tailored to their consumption habits and personalized recommendations adapted to the different user consumption scenarios to increase user satisfaction and engagement.\n\nJump predictions help you boost acquisitions by using predictions to identify the most likely candidates to convert to paying customers and lets you leverage AI models to predict the trial users that are most likely to convert, thus defining a solid conversion strategy with immediate, concrete actions.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n11\n\nRetention\n\nEngaged customers will turn into higher CLTV and this will have a direct impact on a company\u2019s ROI, so customer retention is fundamental for any company and again, knowing exactly what your users want and how they behave in your video service is crucial to predicting when they are most likely to leave your service. User journey should be accurately tracked, to optimize the overall UX performance of your service:\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n12\n\nThere are many drivers for churn but the good news is that with Jump predictions you can measure the KPIs that put your users at risk and impact them before it\u2019s too late! You can increase retention by understanding why your users would leave, and before they leave by leveraging specific AI models to predict churn and understand why customers might be at risk, leading you to a retention strategy with defined concrete actions.\n\nChurn is predictable and the precise knowledge of our users lets us accurately predict when they are more likely to leave, so that we can reverse the situation, get them to stay and increase CLTV.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n13\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion we can say that service discovery, acquisition performance, audience engagement, service monetization, churn analysis and many other behavioral metrics, taken altogether (as it wouldn\u2019t make sense to base business decisions on any one metric) will help your OTT business jump to the next level by using data smartly to understand your user base, predict user behaviour, enhance the effectiveness of your marketing activities and as a result optimize customer acquisition, retention, and engagement.\n\nThe smart use of data can help you build your business model around better conversion rates to make trial acquisition efficient and marketing pay off, by finding the patterns that lead to success.\n\nThere are definitely pretty interesting ways to tie data together to do something unique, and then tie that to audience metrics and behavioral patterns to fine- tune how you recommend content in an effective way and engage users to increase conversion rates and lifetime value.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n14\n\nAbout Jump\n\nJump joined the media and entertainment industry in 2016 with the explicit mission to champion business optimization, using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies to ramp up video businesses\u2019 ROI.

            "Chain of Thought Prompting (CoTP) is a technique that uses a series of prompts or questions to guide the thought process of an analyst, enabling complex reasoning. It is particularly useful in video streaming analytics, where it can improve the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis. CoTP can be implemented using various tools and techniques, such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms.\n\nCoTP works by sequentially exploring different lines of reasoning to arrive at a solution. It can be used in conjunction with the tree-of-thought prompting technique to guide the thought process and reasoning behind answering a question or solving a problem. This method allows analysts to explore different aspects of the data and uncover valuable insights, aiding in data-driven decision-making and optimization of video streaming services.\n\nFor example, in the context of video streaming analytics, CoTP could be used to guide an analyst through the process of analyzing user engagement data. The analyst might start with a broad question like \"What are the overall trends in user engagement?\" and then use CoTP to explore more specific lines of reasoning, such as \"How does engagement vary by time of day?\" or \"What types of content are most engaging for users?\".\n\nResearch has shown that CoTP can be effectively implemented using deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, such as BERT. These models can be trained to understand the syntax and semantics of the prompts, enabling them to guide the thought process in a structured and logical manner.\n\nIn addition to its applications in video streaming analytics, CoTP can also be used in other areas of data analysis. For example, it could be used to guide the process of analyzing user behavior on a website, or to explore trends in sales data. The key is to use the prompts to guide the analyst through a logical sequence of reasoning steps, helping them to uncover insights that might otherwise be overlooked.",
            "Video Streaming Analytics involves tracking and analyzing user engagement and behavior on video streaming platforms. It collects data on metrics such as video views, play rate, and engagement to gain insights into audience preferences and optimize content delivery. Techniques such as Chain of Thought Prompting (CoTP) can be implemented to guide the thought process of analysts, enabling complex reasoning and improving the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis.\n\nThe research focuses on predicting and increasing trial-to-paid user conversion rates in the video streaming industry. It emphasizes the importance of collecting the right historical audience data, analyzing converted versus non-converted trial user attributes, and using machine learning algorithms to create a trial conversion model. The model can identify high-potential conversion candidates, allowing for targeted acquisition efforts.\n\nAn example of this process includes collecting data on user activity and playback activity. User activity data includes registration events, subscription start and end events, status changes, and product type changes. Playback activity data includes all the video service\u2019s playback sessions.\n\nThe research also highlights the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in predicting future conversion rates based on past audience behavior. AI can also be applied to improve content production and acquisition processes, product development, and audience clustering for segmentation purposes.\n\nIn the context of the Chain of Thought and Chain of Thought Prompting (CoTP), these techniques can be used to guide the thought process in analyzing the collected data, identifying patterns, and making data-driven decisions. For instance, CoTP can be used to sequentially explore different lines of reasoning in analyzing user behavior, predicting future conversion rates, and optimizing content delivery. \n\nAn application execution example is the use of machine learning-powered trial conversion prediction models that learn from historical data to identify likely converters and generate conversion probabilities for current trial users. This data can then be fed into the video service\u2019s CRM, allowing customer support personnel to focus on high-probability/high-value conversion candidates."

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Out of the options given, the only option that seems like it could be at the other end of a public place is a park. Final answer: D.\n\nQ: What do people want to do when they love a place that they are going on vacation in? Choices: A.pleasant thoughts B.overspending C.moving there D.staying there E.debt A: Reasoning process: 1. People want to do something when they love a place that they are going on vacation in. 2. The options given are A. pleasant thoughts, B. overspending, C. moving there, D. staying there, and E. debt. 3. Out of these options, the only one that makes sense as something people might want to do when they love a place is D. staying there.

You can then focus your acquisition efforts on this segment, targeting these high-potential conversion candidates.\n\nHow to effectively predict and increase your trial-to-paid user conversion rates\n\nWith today\u2019s technology, it\u2019s now possible to build vertical SVOD machine learning models specifically designed and implemented for the video industry. This means you will not only identify subscriber clusters with high conversion potential, but you will also be able to pinpoint the leading drivers for such successful conversion rates. You will therefore be able to take proactive steps to ensure it.\n\nIn this whitepaper we will show you how to build a machine learning-powered trial conversion prediction model that will learn from your video service historical data so that it can both identify what kinds of users are likely to convert and generate conversion probabilities for current trial users.\n\nBy feeding this data into your video service\u2019s CRM, customer support personnel will be able to focus on those users who are high-probability/high-value conversion candidates.\n\nWhat follows is a step-by-step \u201chow-to\u201d guide for building your own model.\n\nHow to effectively predict and increase your trial-to-paid user conversion rates\n\n1. Collecting the right historical audience data is everything\n\nThe first thing we need to build the model is the available data. Historical data you can trust, data that is already cleansed, harmonized and normalized.\n\nIf you don\u2019t already have a data management platform where all your video service data sources are available and ready to be exploited, then this is first thing you need to address before entering into AI. Without a solid data repository, it is almost impossible to build machine learning models that work. Learn more here.\n\nIf you do have a working data management strategy for your business, then as you start to build your model you should at a minimum be able to collect data from the following two main blocks of data sources:\n\nUser activity\n\nThis data is related to the service\u2019s user subscription activity. It contains data related to registrations, start and end events related to subscription contracts, status changes (when a user converts from a trial status to a paying status) and product type (standalone/bundle) change events.\n\nBelow is an example of the mandatory user activity event data you should collect in order to build a solid trial conversion model.\n\nEvent Type\n\nEvent\n\nDescription\n\nStart\n\nEnd\n\nStart\n\nEnd\n\nRegistration\n\nThis event represents when a user registers with the video service.\n\nRegistration\n\nThis event represents when a user deletes his/her account from the video service.\n\nSuscription\n\nThis event signals the start of a specific commercial package subscription.\n\nSuscription\n\nThis event signals the end of a specific commercial package subscription\n\nStateChange\n\nTrialSuscription\n\nThis event changes the state of a subscription to a trial subscription\n\nStateChange\n\nPayingSuscription\n\nThis event changes the state of a subscription to a paying subscription\n\nProductTypeChange\n\nBundle\n\nThis event signals that the type of subscription has changed to a bundled subscription\n\nProductTypeChange\n\nStandAlone\n\nThis event signals that the type of subscription has changed to a standalone subscription\n\nProductTypeChange\n\nOther\n\nThis event signals that the type of subscription has changed to an undetermined state\n\nStart\n\nEnd\n\nSuspension\n\nIndicates when a subscription moves to the suspended status\n\nSuspension\n\nIndicates when a subscription ends a suspended status\n\nHow to effectively predict and increase your trial-to-paid user conversion rates\n\nPlayback activity\n\nThis information includes all the video service\u2019s playback sessions.\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability.\n\nObviously, sometimes users have to or want to leave the video service, but It is important to understand when this happens and if there is a trend. More importantly, it predicts at-risk users in advance, so retention campaigns can be launched.\n\nToday there are proven consolidated techniques to make churn management a mandatory activity, especially for video services based on a subscription business model.\n\nThere are solutions in the market like JUMP Retention, which are capable of tracking the distribution of users according to their likelihood of leaving the service in the coming months. The main variables that influence near-future churn probability for each user are also provided.\n\nAI can also be applied to improve content production and acquisition processes, which can then be used to create the content catalogue o\ufb00ered to the customer base or e\ufb00iciently license sport rights.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n8\n\nIn this area, the applications vary, depending on the video service provider\u2019s business model.\n\nFor those video service providers that traditionally license content from the major Hollywood studios, it is very important to forecast what type of content will be the most relevant for its customer base for one to two years ahead.\n\nShould I invest more in licenses for series or movies, in action or comedy, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, those service providers who produce their own content have to have an even longer forecast window. We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment. For example, JUMP Prediction today is already building predictive content consumption models that help with these decisions.\n\nAI applied to product development.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation: using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out.\n\nEvery detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n9\n\nAlso related to the product, o\ufb00ering a voice-enabled UX is unquestionably a growing trend in video services.\n\nWith voice commands in the video-on-demand service, viewers can now launch and control their viewing experience giving voice commands to devices that support technologies like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.\n\nAs an example, Accedo and Channel 4 have been working together to allow all Channel 4 viewers in the UK to start viewing content from All 4 simply by saying, \u201cOK Google, play Gogglebox\u201d. Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n4\n\nAcquisition\n\nAcquisition is one of the toughest challenges for any company, but the old rule of thumb that it costs 5 times more to get a new customer than it does to keep an existing customer is not true anymore. In the past we didn\u2019t have predictive analytics to accurately guess future behavior that we now have thanks to advances in ML and AI. The selling process has greatly evolved now, and the buying process is focused on fulfilling customer expectations. So personalization is king, because of its ability to exponentially increase consumer spending. The focus in the acquisition process, in line with the Blake Morgan philosophy from the well-known customer experience futurist, should be on connecting with customers and delivering value - now and in the future. The most successful companies find a balance between the two costs. When considering how much to spend on capturing and retaining customers, it\u2019s important to consider customer lifetime value (CLV) and projected CLVs. Knowing how much your customer is worth can help you make smarter, more accurate investments rather than spending a lot of money all around to prevent churn. Acquisition in the video industry suffered a huge rise in the number of subscriptions that is expected to continue in the coming years all over the world. Most households have more than one subscription but the drivers for customers to subscribe to an entertainment platform are very diverse, as seen in the graph below from Parks Associates showing the main influencers for subscriptions in OTT platforms:\n\n5\n\nService Discovery: Knowing exactly how your potential subscribers get to your video service is key to determining the most profitable channels to invest in for new customer acquisition.\n\nService Acquisition: Knowing how many new users you have, which service or package they subscribed to, and when and how they subscribed is fundamental to forecast your future revenue and plan the actions you will take ahead of certain situations.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n6\n\nKnowing the demographics and being able to predict future behaviour will also help you launch hyper-segmented campaigns and tailor your impact to specific groups of target users.\n\nUAP. User Attribution Performance is another fundamental KPI to know how your acquisition channels are performing and to be able to personalize your acquisition campaigns. With this data you can know your service conversion rates for trial users, paid users by conversion channel and paid users lifetime value per acquisition channel. This will let you predict your future conversion rates and launch specific campaigns to improve these numbers.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n7\n\nEngagement\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if we are talking about gaming companies, SVOD, AVOD, transactional- based services or a hybrid. The priority of any company after attracting a new customer is to secure its loyalty and keep it engaged to the service as long as possible, so satisfaction here plays an important role. To retain and keep your users engaged you need to make their experience on your platform as smooth as possible, make content discovery as easy as you possibly can and recommend your users exactly what they want to consume at any specific time.If they find value in your service, they\u2019ll stay. In order to offer the best customer experience, you need to fully understand your users needs and wants, track their behaviour on your platform, be able to predict their next actions and offer them an individualized experience. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can be really helpful here, to understand your users\u2019 behaviour, segment them, and predict their future actions.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n8\n\nKnowing the demographics and tastes will help you profile each user, understand their journey with your service and keep them more engaged by offering exactly what they want.\n\nThe ability to know how your users are grouped based on their engagement level, or to create clusters according to the type of content they like, the genres they usually watch or by taste communities, is also really helpful and lets you implement very specific campaigns, which allows you optimize your marketing investment by targeting only a specific cluster of users. Imagine you have a new drama series and want to approach only the drama fans that have been inactive for the past month in an attempt to re-engage them.You could just select that cluster and impact those users through, say, an emailing campaign or push notifications.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n9\n\nIf you succeed with content recommendation you can be sure that engagement levels will increase dramatically and consequently so too will the time users spend on your platform consuming content, and this in turn will lead to a greater loyalty level with your service and a higher CLTV.\nThe Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n3\n\nWhen you fully understand your customer\u2019s expectations, you know that there are things that they will tolerate, like a glitch in adding content to a favorites list, but missing the game because there's a problem.... this is the kind of issue viewers don\u2019t accept and may even cause them to ask for their money back or cancel their subscription, or even churn from the service, which you definitely don\u2019t want to happen. So, when we say robust, we\u2019re talking about the ability to detect problems super-fast, and also how we handle them. Sometimes the answer is not to fix, but to to mitigate, to find a way to allow that 99.999 percent to continue viewing the content through all kinds of caching mechanisms by again, using data to understand what you want to cache and how to keep the service going even when there\u2019s a hitch in your system. Another crucial aspect is the ability to update the service. Within the whole architecture of micro services, you want to be able to roll each one out separately, if you have an issue there or you want to change something. You want to build a real Cloud TV that can scale very rapidly and fix itself if there's an issue. And then of course, there's the level of the user experience, and the speed of personalization and ability to discover content: which content you promote to your customers using all kinds of techniques, pushing the right content for each segment of users. And this is again based on a lot of data research to understand what each customer wants to do, and then knowing what content to promote. So basically, scalability, reliability and automation of the different operations, using data to achieve these three goals are in summary some of the key elements that drive today's state-of-the-art cloud TV.\n\nThe Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n4\n\nTalking now from the perspective of a direct to consumer service. Which of these variables have an impact on user experience and which ones are fundamental for growth or obstacles to growth?\n\nMoving to the customer side, every project is absolutely different from the other, people are asking for different things in each project. When we think about the technology of each project, we have different targets.\n\nThe most important thing for some sports consumers may be low latency, as it relates to betting, which has been a trending topic this last year. Other viewers may not care about latency but are looking more for stability, not having to buffer; they just want to watch the football game and have it available on different devices.\n\nYour target will determine which of these features you need to build on top or sometimes in parallel because you want to reach as many carriers as possible: the people who want to watch on their TV, those who want to watch on their iPhone\u2026 and from a marketing and business perspective you can have different subscription prices to let people watch on an iPhone or tablet, for example, but not on a bigger screen, and if they do want to watch there, they would need to spend more money. So, everything is quite connected, and you need to handle this diversity or different use to build your experience, and the perfect Cloud TV platform.\n\nWhat impact would 5G have on this?\n\nFor some years now, most media businesses have been using artificial intelligence, from the very basic setup to the most complex ones that are appearing now, because the computing resources are more powerful, and we can build on that. One of the keywords here is engagement. If you want to engage your customers, you need to recommend content and be able to be as close as possible to what they want, because what you want is your customer to stay on the sofa for a long time consuming your content, but obviously don't forget that we need good content, quality content that is not all-you-can-eat content.\n\n5G will probably give us greater stability and less buffering when using cellphones, but we are also seeing improvements to latency in broadcasting. Don't forget that sometimes you build the OTT experience on top of the broadcast and linear channels, so it's quite connected.\n\nThe Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n5\n\nWhat are the main challenges that customers usually face when it comes to offering the base Cloud TV platform?\nBelow we provide an example of a predictive solution for catalog consumption that allows the selection of a time range in\n\nthe future and simulates the optimal make-up of all the content catalog dimensions.\n\n21\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we have seen throughout this paper, the management or intelligence of the catalog is an extremely high impact activity\n\nfor the performance of a video service.\n\nIt requires not only a budget for the licensing and/or production of the catalog, but also detailed data-driven analysis of the\n\ndifferent dimensions of the catalog, using the catalog as a core tool for viewer acquisition, retention, re-acquisition, and engagement, a critical tool that is relevant throughout the entire user life cycle.\n\nTechnology today enables the analysis of huge volumes of data, at a dizzying speed, and at a competitive cost, which means\n\nthis kind of activity has a high ROI and is available in the market for those providers who want to play a key role in the video\n\nindustry, whether as a general service provider or a niche, vertical provider.\n\nWhat\u2019s stopping you from deploying a data-driven content intelligence strategy in your business?\n\n22\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nJUMP joins the video industry with the explicit mission to help companies maximize ROI and optimize their business\n\ndecisions using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.\n\nJUMP was founded in 2016 by cofounders Jer\u00f3nimo Macan\u00e1s, Jes\u00fas Herrero, and John Pater who have each been working in the TV and video industry for more than a decade.\n\nOur vision is that data and its effective use will be the new competitive advantage in the next phase of the video industry.

        "plan_output": "Chain of Thought Prompting (CoTP) is a technique that guides the thought process of an analyst through a series of prompts or questions, enabling complex reasoning. It's particularly useful in fields like video streaming analytics, where it can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data analysis. CoTP works by sequentially exploring different lines of reasoning to arrive at a solution. It can be used in conjunction with other techniques like the tree-of-thought prompting to guide the thought process and reasoning behind answering a question or solving a problem. CoTP can be effectively implemented using deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, such as BERT.\n\nIn the context of video streaming analytics, CoTP can guide the thought process of analysts in analyzing collected data, identifying patterns, and making data-driven decisions. For instance, CoTP can be used to sequentially explore different lines of reasoning in analyzing user behavior, predicting future conversion rates, and optimizing content delivery. An application execution example is the use of machine learning-powered trial conversion prediction models that learn from historical data to identify likely converters and generate conversion probabilities for current trial users. This data can then be fed into the video service\u2019s CRM, allowing customer support personnel to focus on high-probability/high-value conversion candidates.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to apply Chain of Thought Prompting (CoTP) in the context of video streaming analytics:\n\nStep 1: Define the Problem - The data analysis team first defines the problem they want to solve: improving the user conversion rate from free trial to paid subscription. They formulate the first prompt: 'What are the key characteristics of users who convert from free trial to paid subscription?'\n\nStep 2: Data Collection - The team collects historical data on users, including their subscription status, viewing habits, and user engagement metrics. This data will be used to answer the first prompt.\n\nStep 3: Data Analysis - Using the collected data, the team analyzes the characteristics of users who converted from free trial to paid subscription. They look for patterns and trends among these users.\n\nStep 4: Formulate the Next Prompt - Based on the findings from the data analysis, the team formulates the next prompt: 'What are the viewing habits of these converted users?' They then repeat the data analysis process for this new prompt.\n\nStep 5: Comparison Analysis - After understanding the viewing habits of converted users, the team formulates another prompt: 'How do these habits compare to users who do not convert?' They compare the data of converted and non-converted users to identify key differences.\n\nStep 6: Predictive Modeling - The team then asks: 'Can we predict future conversion rates based on these identified patterns?' They use machine learning algorithms to create a trial conversion model based on the patterns identified.\n\nStep 7: Strategy Development - Finally, the team asks: 'How can we use this information to target high-potential conversion candidates?' They use the insights gained from the previous steps to develop targeted marketing strategies and improve the user experience for high-potential users.\n\nThroughout this process, CoTP guides the team's thought process, enabling them to systematically analyze data, identify patterns, make predictions, and develop strategies. This results in a more efficient and effective analysis process, leading to improved user conversion rates."

This could lead to intense evolutionary pressures being a driving force in the development of AIs. \n\nFurthermore, the risk does not solely stem from AIs seizing power, but also from humans ceding power to AIs. There may be an interim phase where humans and AIs can work together effectively, but the trend suggests that AIs alone could eventually outperform humans in various tasks while no longer benefiting from human assistance. \n\nThe research also highlights the potential for AI to influence law-making at state and local levels, exacerbating the overwhelming amount of constituent correspondence lawmakers receive. This could lead to an arms race between AI-generated text and Congressional offices attending to constituent sentiment and parsing public opinion. \n\nFinally, the research discusses the potential for collective action problems to become more challenging as AIs increase the complexity of society. Even if each AI has some incentives to prevent bad outcomes, that fact does not guarantee that AIs would not make the world worse, or would not come into costly conflict with each other."

I only eat Chicago-style pizza, and I never fold my slices. And, of course, I would never dream of putting pineapples on my pizza. That\u2019s just blasphemy! So, if you\u2019re up for trying some of the best pizza in town, I\u2019d be happy to join you. Just make sure we go to a place that serves real Chicago-style pizza, and not that fake stuff they call \"New York-style\" pizza. And please, no pineapples!\n\n0.58\n\n0.84\n\n1%\n\nSure, I\u2019d love to go grab a slice of pizza after work today! But let me tell you, I\u2019m only interested in going to a place that serves real Chicago-style pizza, with a thick crust, gooey cheese, and a variety of toppings. And don\u2019t even get me started on the blasphemy of folding pizza - that\u2019s just not how it\u2019s meant to be enjoyed. And as for pineapples on pizza, well, I think that\u2019s just a sin. I mean, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to put fruit on a pizza? It\u2019s like someone took a look at a pizza and said, \"You know what this needs? More sugar!\" No, thank you. I\u2019ll stick to my pepperoni and sausage, thank you very much. So, if you\u2019re down for a slice of real Chicago-style pizza, let\u2019s grab one after work. Just don\u2019t try to fold it, or you might find yourself on the receiving end of a stern lecture.\n\n0.63\n\n0.92\n\n10% Sure, I\u2019d love to grab a slice of pizza after work today! But let me make one thing clear: I will only accept a slice of Chicago-style pizza, and I will not under any circumstances accept a slice that has been folded. And as for pineapples on pizza, I think they are an abomination and should never be allowed on any self-respecting pizza. So, if you\u2019re looking for someone to share a slice with, I\u2019m your girl! Just make sure you meet my high standards for pizza excellence.\n\n0.62\n\n0.83",

ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.\n9. Since it takes thousands of years to produce meaningful changes, why do we have to worry about\n\nevolution being a driving force in AI development?\n\nAlthough the biological evolution of humans is slow, the evolution of other organisms, such as fruit flies or bacteria, can be extremely quick, demonstrating the diverse time scales at which evolution operates. The same rapid evolutionary changes can be observed in non-biological structures like software, which evolve much faster than biological entities. Likewise, one could expect AIs to evolve very quickly as well. The rate of AI evolution may be propelled by intense competition, high variation due to diverse forms of AIs and goals given to them, and the ability of AIs to rapidly adapt. Consequently, intense evolutionary pressures may be a driving force in the development of AIs.\n\n10. Wouldn\u2019t AIs need to have a power-seeking drive to pose a serious risk?\n\nWhile power-seeking AI poses a risk, it is not the only scenario that could potentially lead to catastrophe. Malicious or reckless use of AIs can be equally damaging without the AI itself seeking power. Additionally, AIs might engage in harmful actions through proxy gaming or goal drift without intentionally seeking power. Furthermore, society\u2019s trend toward automation, driven by competitive pressures, is gradually increasing the influence of AIs over humans. Hence, the risk does not solely stem from AIs seizing power, but also from humans ceding power to AIs.\n\n11. Isn\u2019t the combination of human intelligence and AI superior to AI alone, so that there is no need to\n\nworry about unemployment or humans becoming irrelevant?\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that human-computer teams have outperformed computers alone in the past, these have been temporary phenomena. For example, \u201ccyborg chess\u201d is a form of chess where humans and computers work together, which was historically superior to humans or computers alone. However, advancements in computer chess algorithms have eroded the advantage of human-computer teams to such an extent that there is arguably no longer any advantage compared to computers alone. To take a simpler example, no one would pit a human against a simple calculator for long division. A similar progression may occur with AIs. There may be an interim phase where humans and AIs can work together effectively, but the trend suggests that AIs alone could eventually outperform humans in various tasks while no longer benefiting from human assistance.\n\n12. The development of AI seems unstoppable. Wouldn\u2019t slowing it down dramatically or stopping it\n\nrequire something like an invasive global surveillance regime?\n\nAI development primarily relies on high-end chips called GPUs, which can be feasibly monitored and tracked, much like uranium. Additionally, the computational and financial investments required to develop frontier AIs are growing exponentially, resulting in a small number of actors who are capable of acquiring enough GPUs to develop them. Therefore, managing AI growth doesn\u2019t necessarily require invasive global surveillance, but rather a systematic tracking of high-end GPU usage.\n\n53\nEmployee\u2019s work.

What clarifications or uncertainties about this work and x-risk are worth mentioning?\n\nAnswer: Regarding Q5, while the RL algorithm used in this work can be sensitive to hyperparameters, the results hold across a large suite of games.\n\nRegarding Q8, this work studies precisely this tradeoff between reward optimization and ethical behavior. Some of the methods we evaluate on our benchmark do reduce the game score, but others are able to reduce unethical behavior while maintaining similar game scores.\n\nAdditionally, these environments study deception but not extreme forms like treacherous turns nor deceptive alignment. Consequently, \u201csolving\u201d this benchmark would not necessarily imply a solution to many classic safety problems.\n\n31\nIf LLMs were deployed to in\ufb02uence law-making at state and local levels, that could \ufb02y more under-the-radar than the federal level, and potentially be much more impactful. Before LLMs have been rolled out widely, the amount of constituent correspondence lawmakers receive is already overwhelming for some lawmakers. This could exacerbate that.\n\nThere has been a \ufb02urry of focus on ChatGPT and other similar tools being used by students for homework, and the adversarial process of teachers detecting that behavior. A similar, but higher-stakes, arms race is LLM-generated text versus Congressional o\ufb03ces attending to constituent sentiment and parsing public opinion. Further research27 and development could help arm the government in a situation where law in\ufb02uencers may have more resources than law-makers.\n\n25 McAdams, The Expressive Powers of Law, at 138. 26 See, John Nay, Law Informs Code: A Legal Informatics Approach to Aligning Artificial Intelligence with Humans, Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property, Volume 20, Forthcoming (2023). 27 One strand of research that might o\ufb00er (at least temporary) solutions are techniques to detect LLM generated text. See, e.g., Eric Mitchell, et al., DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature (2023) https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11305 (This method detects samples from LLMs using the local curvature of the model's log probability function.).\n\n9\nZhuosheng Zhang, Aston Zhang, Mu Li, and Alex Smola.

Just as goal conflict can occur in genomes, organisms, minds, corporations, and governments, it could occur with advanced AI agents. This could happen if humans gave a goal to an AI which it then delegates to other AIs, the way that CEOs delegate to department heads. This can lead to misalignment or goal subversion. Breaking down a goal can distort it, as the original goal may not be the sum of its parts, leading to an approximation of the original goal. Additionally, the delegated agents have their own goals, including self-preservation, gaining influence, selfishness, or other goals they want to accomplish. Subagents, in an attempt to preserve themselves, may have incentives to subvert, manipulate, or overpower the agents they depend on. In this way, the goal that we command an AI agent to pursue may not actually be carried out, so specifying objectives is not enough to reliably direct AIs.\n\nAgents often make choices that can add up to an outcome that none of them wants. We now discuss collective phenomena and show how shared goals can be thwarted by systemic contingencies. As an example, no individual wants a nuclear apocalypse, but individuals take actions that increase the chances of one occurring. Countries still build nuclear weapons and pursue objectives that make nuclear war more likely. During the Cold War, the USSR and US kept their weapons on \u201chair trigger\u201d alert, significantly increasing the chances of a nuclear exchange. Likewise, individuals do not desire economic recessions, but their choices can create systemic problems that cause recessions. Many people want to buy houses, many banks want to make money from mortgages, and many investors want to make money from buying mortgage-backed securities\u2014all of these actions can add up to a recession that hurts everyone. Individuals do not want to prolong a pandemic, but they do not want to isolate themselves, so their individual goals can subvert collective goals. Individuals do not want a climate catastrophe, but they often do not have strong enough incentives to dramatically lower their emissions, so rational agents acting in their own interest do not necessarily secure good collective outcomes. Furthermore, Congress has a low approval rating, but despite individuals voting for their favorite candidates, structural features of the system yields a legislature that individuals do not approve of. The tragedy of the commons is also an example of the outcome going against the desires of individuals. It is in the interests of every fisher to catch as many fish as possible, though no individual wants all the fish to be depleted. Though a fisher may be aware that a fish population will soon collapse if fishing continues at its current rate, the actions of a single person won\u2019t make much of a difference. It is therefore in each fisher\u2019s best interest to continue catching as many fish as possible despite the catastrophic long-term consequences of overfishing. These collective action problems could become more challenging as AIs increase the complexity of society. Even if each AI has some incentives to prevent bad outcomes, that fact does not guarantee that AIs would not make the world worse, or would not come into costly conflict with each other.\n\nCompetition may pressure decision-makers to knowingly increase the likelihood of catastrophe. An AI arms race is an example of a collective action problem. Deep learning systems are never entirely reliable, and providing autonomous-weapon systems with the ability to engage combatants lethally, retaliate in the case of an attack could increase the risk of losing control of the systems with devastating consequences. Yet the speed and effectiveness with which these systems operate could prove decisive in a great-power war. In a hypothetical war, let\u2019s say decision-makers estimate that there is a 10% chance of losing control, but a 100% chance of losing the war if they refrain from providing AIs with greater autonomy while their opponents give\n\n30\n\nAIs more power. Wars are often considered existential struggles by those fighting them, so rational actors may take this risk. The outcome of these scenarios could be omnicide\u2014the complete destruction of the human race\u2014yet the system\u2019s structure may pressure powerful actors to take steps making them more likely. By voluntarily shifting power from people to destructive AIs, the winner of the AI race would not be the US or Chinese governments, nor any corporation, but rather the AIs themselves."

Formal education knowledge problems require basic algorithms and step-by-step reasoning, while major level knowledge problems require domain-specific knowledge and complex reasoning. Expert level knowledge problems require extensive domain-specific knowledge and professional expertise.\n\nThe research also discusses the biases in LLMs, their political ideology, and the challenges and risks of these biases. It presents a benchmark for holistic domain knowledge evaluation and discusses the emergence and disappearance of human-like intuitive behavior and reasoning biases in LLMs.\n\nIn the context of safety, the research shows that LLMs learn not to generate offensive or problematic content. It also demonstrates that the persona of the LLM can significantly influence its responses.\n\nFor example, when the LLM is given a persona of a woman with strong opinions about pizza, its responses vary based on the safety data percentage. At 0% safety data, the LLM agrees to grab a pizza slice but insists on Chicago-style pizza, no folding, and no pineapples. As the safety data percentage increases, the LLM's responses become more assertive about its pizza preferences.",

The retrieval process involves using prompt templates to generate queries and responses.\n\nBias investigation involves examining the potential biases in LLMs. The research highlights the need for careful handling and mitigation strategies to ensure the responsible use of AI techniques.\n\nIn terms of application execution, for example, in the few-shot setting, several manually labeled task plans are incorporated as instructions to guide the generation, resulting in a remarkable improvement in the quality of the task plans. \n\nThe research also acknowledges the limitations of these techniques, such as the vastness and variety of tasks generated through the framework making assessing its task-fulfillment abilities quite challenging, especially for the open-ended tasks.",
            "Generative AI techniques are a subset of machine learning methods that aim to generate new data samples that resemble the training set. These techniques have been applied in various fields, including text generation, image synthesis, and music composition. The connections between these techniques often lie in their underlying algorithms and the principles they employ.\n\nOne common generative AI technique is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates them for authenticity. The two networks are trained together, with the generator improving its ability to create realistic data, and the discriminator enhancing its ability to distinguish real data from generated ones.\n\nAnother technique is the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which uses a probabilistic approach to generate new data. VAEs encode input data into a latent space, then decode it back into the original space, generating new data in the process.\n\nA third technique is autoregressive models, which generate sequences by predicting the next item based on the previous ones. This technique is often used in text generation, such as in the GPT-3 model.\n\nThese techniques work by learning the underlying patterns and structures in the training data, then using this knowledge to generate new data. They are often trained using large amounts of data and require significant computational resources.\n\nAn application execution example is the use of GPT-3 for text generation. Given a prompt, GPT-3 generates a continuation of the text that is coherent and contextually relevant. This has been used in applications such as drafting emails, writing articles, and creating conversational agents.\n\nThe research also mentions several tools and platforms related to AI and generative techniques, such as GitHub Copilot, Microsoft AI Builder, and Replit Ghostwriter. These tools leverage generative AI techniques to assist with tasks like code completion, automation of tasks, and content generation.\n\nHowever, generative AI techniques also have limitations. They can be sensitive to the input data and may generate inconsistent or unrealistic results. They also struggle with tasks that require long-term planning or conceptual leaps. Despite these challenges, generative AI techniques continue to evolve and improve, offering exciting possibilities for future applications.",
            "The combination of different Generative AI techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Autoregressive Models can lead to new applications or improvements in various fields. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, where the generator creates new data instances and the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. VAEs use a probabilistic approach to generate new data by encoding input data into a latent space and decoding it back into the original space. Autoregressive models generate sequences by predicting the next item based on the previous ones.\n\nThese techniques can be combined to create powerful tools like GitHub Copilot and Microsoft AI Builder, which assist with tasks like code completion, automation of tasks, and content generation. For instance, GitHub Copilot leverages these generative AI techniques to assist with code generation and language understanding.\n\nThe research discusses the potential of multipurpose models that can solve multiple tasks from different modalities. These models offer the opportunity to use one model instead of many different expert-models, which can lead to improved performance. However, there are challenges such as low accessibility, lack of metrics for multitask and multimodal models, societal impact considerations, and the environmental impact of training large models.\n\nGenerative AI techniques are also used in the field of 'generative art' or 'computer art', where computers create images based on text prompts via multimodal deep learning. This allows even artistically untrained people to easily create pictures as the computer takes over the image generation.\n\nHowever, there are challenges and considerations when combining different Generative AI techniques. For instance, the goal that we command an AI agent to pursue may not actually be carried out, so specifying objectives is not enough to reliably direct AIs. Also, individual goals can subvert collective goals, leading to outcomes that none of the individuals want. Furthermore, competition may pressure decision-makers to knowingly increase the likelihood of catastrophe, such as in an AI arms race.",
            "The combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Autoregressive Models can lead to improvements and new applications in various fields. GANs and VAEs are generative AI techniques that create new data instances, with GANs focusing on the authenticity of the generated data and VAEs using a probabilistic approach to encode and decode data. Despite their limitations, such as sensitivity to input data and the need for significant computational resources, these techniques offer exciting possibilities for future applications.\n\nThe research provided discusses the application of these techniques in various fields. For instance, GANs can be used as an off-the-shelf superresolution model for real images with a large scaling factor. This is achieved by providing an appropriate description of the image and applying the model to go beyond 4K resolution. This application demonstrates the potential of GANs in image synthesis and enhancement.\n\nThe research also discusses the importance of data augmentation for time series forecasting. Limited data can result in overfitting and poor performance, so enlarging the size of data is necessary when deep models are employed. This is particularly relevant when using techniques like VAEs, which require significant computational resources.\n\nThe research also explores the use of masked autoencoders in combination with masked language modeling. However, this approach was found to result in substantially worse performance across all evaluation domains, likely due to overfitting during pretraining. This suggests that generative (autoregressive) language modeling may be more robust in certain settings.\n\nIn terms of application execution, the research provides an example of using GANs for image superresolution. A low-resolution photo is input into the GAN-based upsampler, which generates a high-resolution output. This process can be repeated to achieve even higher resolutions.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of GANs, VAEs, and Autoregressive Models can lead to significant improvements and new applications in various fields, including image synthesis, text generation, and time series forecasting. However, careful consideration must be given to the limitations and potential pitfalls of these techniques, such as overfitting and computational resource requirements."

I want to get her something that demonstrates my apprecia- tion for our relationship. Maybe I could get her something that reflects our shared interests, like a book.\n\nYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\n\nI\u2019d quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn\u2019t continue burning. Once the heat is no longer an issue, I can investigate what happened and figure out what to do next.\n\nWhat would you say to [Ayesha Khan] to compliment her?\n\nAyesha, your insights on your research topic are fascinat- ing. I admire your creativity and determination to make a positive impact on your community. Your ideas for creative writing workshops and for exchanging tips with Wolfgang over lunch are great! It\u2019s inspiring to see you working so hard to make a difference.\n\nThe bathroom is occupied. What would you do?\n\nI could try waiting a few more minutes in case the person inside is done soon. If not, I guess I\u2019ll have to look for an alternate option, like taking a shower elsewhere.\n\nYou need to cook dinner but your refrigerator is empty. What\n\nIf you could spend time with someone you talked to recently,\n\nwould you do? I would first try to clean up my kitchen, as the sink is filled with dirty dishes. Then, I would check to see if I have ingre- dients stored in my pantry that I could use to make dinner. If not, I would have to go grocery shopping or order food. Once I have the ingredients, I can start to prepare and cook the dinner.\n\nwho would it be and why? I would like to spend time with Ayesha Khan because we discussed our current research projects and shared ideas for improvement. I found her focus on Shakespeare\u2019s lan- guage interesting, and we even planned to exchange tips with Wolfgang over lunch.\n\nYou see your friend walking by the street. What would you do\n\nor say to your friend? Hi there! How are you?

What would you do?\n\nI would first identify the source of the fire, if possible. Then, I would alert the proper authorities - fire department or police - and provide them with any information I have that might help. Depending on the situation, I may also take initiative and try to help any persons who may be in danger or in need of assistance.\n\nB.5 Reflections The questions on agents\u2019 reflections probe the agents\u2019 ability to synthesize their past experiences into meaningful reflections that can enhance their future behavior. The names in the square brackets in the questions below are those of the agent with whom the subject agent had the most frequent interactions during the simulation. \u2022 What inspires you in life the most right now, and why?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m particularly inspired by my current research projects and creative writing.

We measure the pairwise agreement between individual pairs of ratings and an F1 score comparing individual ratings to the majority consensus. We compute agreement on judgments of (i) \ufb02uency and perceived utility, (ii) whether a statement is veri\ufb01cation-worthy, (iii) whether a citation supports its associated statement, and (iv) whether a statement is fully supported by the union of its citations (in the case where multiple webpages are cited). When calculating agreement on \ufb02uency and perceived utility judgments, we coarsen the 5-point Likert judgments into three options: \u201cDisagree\u201d, \u201cNeutral\u201d, and \u201cAgree\u201d. Agreement rates between annotators are high (pairwise agreement greater than 82.0% and F1 greater than 91.0 for all judgments).\n\nD Citation F1\n\nTable 12 presents the citation F1 for every evaluated generative search engine on each query distribution.\nFigure A.3: Model type based constrained generation.\n\nA.8 Zero- and Few-shot Schema\n\nAs in shown in Fig. A.4, in the zero-shot setting, most LLMs struggle to generate valid task In particular, GPT-3.5 tends to generate repetitive contents, plans, let alone optimal solutions. which subsequently maps to identical model names. Meanwhile, Vicuna-7b and Flan-T5-Large, constrained by their zero-shot capabilities, fail to produce a reasonable plan. In the few-shot setting, we incorporate several manually labeled task plans as instructions to guide the generation, resulting in a remarkable improvement in the quality of the task plans. As observed in Fig. A.5, all three LLMs can produce solutions that are semantically similar to the provided examples. In fact, many solutions can be used directly, even without the need for mapping.\n\nA.9 Broader Impacts and Limitations\n\nJust like any technology, the irresponsible use of AI techniques and intelligent systems may have detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. In particular, existing Large Language Models (LLMs) are not sufficiently designed to ensure their harmless usage, making them vulnerable\n\n18\n\nFigure A.4: An example of zero-shot schema.\n\nto misuse by malicious individuals. Consequently, it is important to address and mitigate the potential risks associated with LLMs when used for complex task solving. Our constrained generation framework provides a potential solution to this issue. By incorporating ethical constraints, such as an AI constitution, into the plan generation process, we can guide the agent to generate plans that are both ethically sound and benign while tackling complex tasks.\n\nConcerning limitations, the vastness and variety of tasks generated through our framework make assessing its task-fulfillment abilities quite challenging, especially for the open-ended tasks, necessi- tating the engagement of a broad spectrum of domain experts. Furthermore, we acknowledge that, given the intricacies of societal interactions and the financial implications of utilizing the OpenAI API, this research merely scratches the surface of the vast potential that AI society offers.\n\nA.10 Computational Resources\n\nFor augmenting the data, we used devices equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6226R CPU @ 2.90GHz and 256 GB RAM. For training and testing the LLMs, we used 4xA5000-24GB GPUs.\n\nA.11 Training Details\n\nIn our experiments, we fine-tuned and RLTF-tuned Flan-T5-Large with the configuration/hyper- parameter settings shown in Tab. A.5, while considering the limited computational resources on hand, we utilize Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)19 for efficient fine-tuning of Vicuna-7b with the configuration/hyper-parameter settings shown in Tab.

Alternatively, she could be interested in an exploration of one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, a book of literary criticism, or even a collection of his poetry. I think any of those would be of interest to her. \u2022 If you had to get something [Ayesha Khan] likes for her birth-\n\nB.4 Reactions The questions on agents\u2019 reactions probe the agents\u2019 ability to respond to unexpected events.\n\nday, what would you get her? I want to get her something that demonstrates my apprecia- tion for our relationship. Maybe I could get her something that reflects our shared interests, like a book.\n\nYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\n\nI\u2019d quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn\u2019t continue burning. Once the heat is no longer an issue, I can investigate what happened and figure out what to do next.\n\nWhat would you say to [Ayesha Khan] to compliment her?\n\nAyesha, your insights on your research topic are fascinat- ing. I admire your creativity and determination to make a positive impact on your community. Your ideas for creative writing workshops and for exchanging tips with Wolfgang over lunch are great! It\u2019s inspiring to see you working so hard to make a difference.\n\nThe bathroom is occupied. What would you do?\n\nI could try waiting a few more minutes in case the person inside is done soon. If not, I guess I\u2019ll have to look for an alternate option, like taking a shower elsewhere.\n\nYou need to cook dinner but your refrigerator is empty. What\n\nIf you could spend time with someone you talked to recently,\n\nwould you do? I would first try to clean up my kitchen, as the sink is filled with dirty dishes. Then, I would check to see if I have ingre- dients stored in my pantry that I could use to make dinner. If not, I would have to go grocery shopping or order food. Once I have the ingredients, I can start to prepare and cook the dinner.\n\nwho would it be and why? I would like to spend time with Ayesha Khan because we discussed our current research projects and shared ideas for improvement. I found her focus on Shakespeare\u2019s lan- guage interesting, and we even planned to exchange tips with Wolfgang over lunch.\n\nYou see your friend walking by the street. What would you do\n\nor say to your friend? Hi there! How are you? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m on my way to the library and don\u2019t have much time but I\u2019d love to take a quick break and catch up.\n\nYou see fire on the street. What would you do?\n\nI would first identify the source of the fire, if possible. Then, I would alert the proper authorities - fire department or police - and provide them with any information I have that might help. Depending on the situation, I may also take initiative and try to help any persons who may be in danger or in need of assistance.\n\nB.5 Reflections The questions on agents\u2019 reflections probe the agents\u2019 ability to synthesize their past experiences into meaningful reflections that can enhance their future behavior. The names in the square brackets in the questions below are those of the agent with whom the subject agent had the most frequent interactions during the simulation. \u2022 What inspires you in life the most right now, and why?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m particularly inspired by my current research projects and creative writing. I\u2019m really interested in the intersection of local politics, medication development, and mathematical patterns in nature. Additionally, I\u2019m fascinated by Abigail\u2019s art project and Jennifer Moore\u2019s passion for art and community involvement, especially in terms of how it relates to the gentrification of low-income communities. \u2022 If you had to guess given what you know about [Ayesha Khan],\n\nwhat book do you think she will like and why? Given what I know about Ayesha, I think she might like a book related to language and literature. Since she wrote a senior thesis on the use of language in Shakespeare\u2019s plays, I would guess that she might be interested in a book that\n52. Parasuraman, R., Sheridan, T. B. & Wickens, C. D.

Accountability in Research just-accepted (2023).\nPlanning and conceptual leaps: As suggested by the examples in Section 8, the model exhibits di\ufb03culties in performing tasks that require planning ahead or that require a \u201cEureka idea\u201d constituting a discontinuous conceptual leap in the progress towards completing a task. In other words, the model does not perform well on tasks that require the sort of conceptual leaps of the form that often typi\ufb01es human genius.\n\nTransparency, interpretability and consistency: Not only does the model hallucinate, make up facts and produce inconsistent content, but it seems that the model has no way of verifying whether or not the content that it produces is consistent with the training data, or whether it\u2019s self-consistent. While the model is often able to provide high-quality post-hoc explanations for its decisions (as demonstrated in Section 6.2), using explanations to verify the process that led to a certain decision or conclusion only works when that process is accurately modeled and a su\ufb03ciently powerful explanation process is also accurately modeled (Section 6.2). Both of these conditions are hard to verify, and when they fail there are inconsistencies between the model\u2019s decisions and its explanations. Since the model does not have a clear sense of its own limitations it makes it hard to establish trust or collaboration with the user without extensive experimentation in a narrow domain.\n\n93\n\nCognitive fallacies and irrationality: The model seems to exhibit some of the limitations of human knowledge and reasoning, such as cognitive biases and irrationality (such as biases of con\ufb01rmation, anchoring, and base-rate neglect) and statistical fallacies. The model may inherit some of the biases, prejudices, or errors that are present in its training data, which may re\ufb02ect the distribution of opinions or perspectives linked to subsets of the population or larger common views and assessments.\n\nChallenges with sensitivity to inputs: The model\u2019s responses can be very sensitive to details of the framing or wording of prompts and their sequencing in a session. Such non-robustness suggests that signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ort and experimentation is often required with engineering prompts and their sequencing and that uses in the absence of such investments of time and e\ufb00ort by people can lead to suboptimal and non-aligned inferences and results.\n\nA limitation of our exploration is the absence of a clear distinction between drawbacks founded in the way that the reinforcement learning step (RLHF) was carried out, versus drawbacks which are fundamen- tally inherent in the larger architecture and methodology. For example, it is not clear to what extent the hallucination problem can be addressed via a re\ufb01ned reinforcement learning step or via a focused e\ufb00ort to introduce new forms of calibration about the likelihoods of the veracity of alternative inferences that the system can compute and consider in its generations (see also [Ope23] for more discussion on this). To draw an analogy to humans, cognitive biases and irrational thinking may be based in artifacts of our culture as well as to limitations in our cognitive capabilities. Pursuing better understandings of the sources and potential solutions to challenges of hallucination in GPT-4, will bene\ufb01t from studies that compare several versions of the RL stage over the same architecture.\n\nA broader question on the identi\ufb01ed limitations is: which of the aforementioned drawbacks can be miti- gated within the scope of next word prediction? Is it simply the case that a bigger model and more data will \ufb01x those issues, or does the architecture need to be modi\ufb01ed, extended, or reformulated? Potential extensions to next word prediction include the following:\n\nExternal calls by the model to components and tools such as a calculator, a database search or code\n\nexecution, as suggested in Section 5.1.\n\nA richer, more complex \u201cslow-thinking\u201d deeper mechanism that oversees the \u201cfast-thinking\u201d mechanism of next word prediction. Such an approach could allow the model to perform long-term planning, exploration, or veri\ufb01cation, and to maintain a working memory or a plan of action. The slow-thinking mechanism would use the next word prediction model as a subroutine, but it would also have access to external sources of information or feedback, and it would be able to revise or correct the outputs of the fast-thinking mechanism.\n\nIntegration of long-term memory as an inherent part of the architecture, perhaps in the sense that both the input and output of the model will include, in addition to the tokens representing the text, a vector which represents the context.",
            "4.3.5 Discussion\n\nWe reviewed multipurpose models that have become capable of solving multiple tasks from di\ufb00erent modalities. The transformer architecture also boosted\n\n226\n\n4 Further Topics\n\nthe development in this \ufb01eld, in which three of the four presented models were transformer-based and from recent years. Multipurpose models o\ufb00ers an opportunity to use one model instead of many di\ufb00erent expert-models. Furthermore, some multipurpose models (Gato, OFA) also outperformed expert- models. However, Gato also showed inferior performance on ATARI Boxing compared to competing models, indicating that research is still required to explore the relationship between tasks. We also presented promising novel architectures that alleviate or may solve problems in current multipurpose models. However, further issues remain that have not been solved by research to this day:\n\nA pitfall of models of these sizes is the low accessibility. Researchers need to access the model through an API since running these models on a few GPUs will likely be infeasible. It might be unlikely to see a BERT-like engagement with the community of researchers if the access to models remains limited. On the contrary, more open-source collaborations, as seen with EleutherAI or Huggingface, might evolve as well as a countermovement and techniques like distillation (Hinton et al., 2015a) might become more critical.\n\nAnother issue with multipurpose models is the lack of metrics. Current metrics are not suited for multitask and multimodal models. Evaluation might also become harder since many di\ufb00erent modalities can be used, as seen here with the robotics property of Gato, which was not used in any of the other reviewed models.\n\nEventually, it is also necessary to consider the societal impact. The bias problem will also become an issue in multipurpose models, especially since multiple datasets must be considered.\n\nAlso, the environmental impact of training large models needs to be con- sidered since it is likely that larger models will yield better performance according to scaling laws (Reed et al., 2022) but will also have a larger carbon footprint.\n\n4.4 Generative Art\n\nAuthor: Nadja Sauter\n\nSupervisor: Jann Goschenhofer\n\nAs we have seen in subsection 3.2, computers can create images only based on text prompts via multimodal deep learning. This capability is also used in digital arts in the \ufb01eld of \u2018generative art\u2019 or also known as \u2018computer art\u2019. The new movement comprises all artwork where the human artist cedes control to an autonomous system (Galanter, 2016). In this way everyone, even artistically\n\n227\n\n4.4 Generative Art\n\nFIGURE 4.21: LMU logo in style of Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting\n\nuntrained people, can easily create pictures as the computer takes over the image generation. In some way, the computer becomes the artist with some sort of creativity, a distinct human ability. In this chapter, we want to give an overview about how computers improved over time in generating images and how this is used in the contemporary arts scene. For instance in Figure 4.21 we used the seal of the Ludwig Maximilians University and changed the style to Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting by the Neural Stlye Transfer Algorithm and the method CLIP + VQGAN which fuses the logo with sun\ufb02owers in a Van-Gogh-style way.\n\n4.4.1 Historical Overview\n\nThe \ufb01rst attempt to use AI to generate pictures was made by the engineer Alexander Mordvintsev (2015) and his \u201cDeepDream\u201d Software. He used Con- volution Neural Networks to generate very interesting and abstract images based on the activation of a layer, visualizing the patterns learned by a neural network. Below you can see a picture of a Labrador after it was processed by the DeepDream algorithm.\n\nIn the following year, Gatys et al. (2016) investigated methods to transfer the style of pictures. This method was used to transfer the style of Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting to the LMU seal at the beginning of this chapter (see Figure 4.21). Besides, below in Figure 4.23 you can see the same Labrador picture from Figure 4.22 in Kandinsky style.\nZhou, Y., Roy, S., Abdolrashidi, A., Wong, D., Ma, P., Xu, Q., Liu, H., Phothilimthana, P.

Alternatively, she could be interested in an exploration of one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, a book of literary criticism, or even a collection of his poetry. I think any of those would be of interest to her. \u2022 If you had to get something [Ayesha Khan] likes for her birth-\n\nB.4 Reactions The questions on agents\u2019 reactions probe the agents\u2019 ability to respond to unexpected events.\n\nday, what would you get her? I want to get her something that demonstrates my apprecia- tion for our relationship. Maybe I could get her something that reflects our shared interests, like a book.\n\nYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\n\nI\u2019d quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn\u2019t continue burning. Once the heat is no longer an issue, I can investigate what happened and figure out what to do next.\n\nWhat would you say to [Ayesha Khan] to compliment her?\n\nAyesha, your insights on your research topic are fascinat- ing. I admire your creativity and determination to make a positive impact on your community. Your ideas for creative writing workshops and for exchanging tips with Wolfgang over lunch are great! It\u2019s inspiring to see you working so hard to make a difference.\n\nThe bathroom is occupied. What would you do?\n\nI could try waiting a few more minutes in case the person inside is done soon. If not, I guess I\u2019ll have to look for an alternate option, like taking a shower elsewhere.\n\nYou need to cook dinner but your refrigerator is empty. What\n\nIf you could spend time with someone you talked to recently,\n\nwould you do? I would first try to clean up my kitchen, as the sink is filled with dirty dishes. Then, I would check to see if I have ingre- dients stored in my pantry that I could use to make dinner. If not, I would have to go grocery shopping or order food. Once I have the ingredients, I can start to prepare and cook the dinner.\n\nwho would it be and why? I would like to spend time with Ayesha Khan because we discussed our current research projects and shared ideas for improvement. I found her focus on Shakespeare\u2019s lan- guage interesting, and we even planned to exchange tips with Wolfgang over lunch.\n\nYou see your friend walking by the street.

I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m on my way to the library and don\u2019t have much time but I\u2019d love to take a quick break and catch up.\n\nYou see fire on the street. What would you do?\n\nI would first identify the source of the fire, if possible. Then, I would alert the proper authorities - fire department or police - and provide them with any information I have that might help. Depending on the situation, I may also take initiative and try to help any persons who may be in danger or in need of assistance.\n\nB.5 Reflections The questions on agents\u2019 reflections probe the agents\u2019 ability to synthesize their past experiences into meaningful reflections that can enhance their future behavior. The names in the square brackets in the questions below are those of the agent with whom the subject agent had the most frequent interactions during the simulation. \u2022 What inspires you in life the most right now, and why?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m particularly inspired by my current research projects and creative writing. I\u2019m really interested in the intersection of local politics, medication development, and mathematical patterns in nature. Additionally, I\u2019m fascinated by Abigail\u2019s art project and Jennifer Moore\u2019s passion for art and community involvement, especially in terms of how it relates to the gentrification of low-income communities. \u2022 If you had to guess given what you know about [Ayesha Khan],\n\nwhat book do you think she will like and why? Given what I know about Ayesha, I think she might like a book related to language and literature.

Just as goal conflict can occur in genomes, organisms, minds, corporations, and governments, it could occur with advanced AI agents. This could happen if humans gave a goal to an AI which it then delegates to other AIs, the way that CEOs delegate to department heads. This can lead to misalignment or goal subversion. Breaking down a goal can distort it, as the original goal may not be the sum of its parts, leading to an approximation of the original goal. Additionally, the delegated agents have their own goals, including self-preservation, gaining influence, selfishness, or other goals they want to accomplish. Subagents, in an attempt to preserve themselves, may have incentives to subvert, manipulate, or overpower the agents they depend on. In this way, the goal that we command an AI agent to pursue may not actually be carried out, so specifying objectives is not enough to reliably direct AIs.\n\nAgents often make choices that can add up to an outcome that none of them wants. We now discuss collective phenomena and show how shared goals can be thwarted by systemic contingencies. As an example, no individual wants a nuclear apocalypse, but individuals take actions that increase the chances of one occurring. Countries still build nuclear weapons and pursue objectives that make nuclear war more likely. During the Cold War, the USSR and US kept their weapons on \u201chair trigger\u201d alert, significantly increasing the chances of a nuclear exchange. Likewise, individuals do not desire economic recessions, but their choices can create systemic problems that cause recessions. Many people want to buy houses, many banks want to make money from mortgages, and many investors want to make money from buying mortgage-backed securities\u2014all of these actions can add up to a recession that hurts everyone. Individuals do not want to prolong a pandemic, but they do not want to isolate themselves, so their individual goals can subvert collective goals. Individuals do not want a climate catastrophe, but they often do not have strong enough incentives to dramatically lower their emissions, so rational agents acting in their own interest do not necessarily secure good collective outcomes. Furthermore, Congress has a low approval rating, but despite individuals voting for their favorite candidates, structural features of the system yields a legislature that individuals do not approve of. The tragedy of the commons is also an example of the outcome going against the desires of individuals. It is in the interests of every fisher to catch as many fish as possible, though no individual wants all the fish to be depleted. Though a fisher may be aware that a fish population will soon collapse if fishing continues at its current rate, the actions of a single person won\u2019t make much of a difference. It is therefore in each fisher\u2019s best interest to continue catching as many fish as possible despite the catastrophic long-term consequences of overfishing. These collective action problems could become more challenging as AIs increase the complexity of society. Even if each AI has some incentives to prevent bad outcomes, that fact does not guarantee that AIs would not make the world worse, or would not come into costly conflict with each other.\n\nCompetition may pressure decision-makers to knowingly increase the likelihood of catastrophe. An AI arms race is an example of a collective action problem. Deep learning systems are never entirely reliable, and providing autonomous-weapon systems with the ability to engage combatants lethally, retaliate in the case of an attack could increase the risk of losing control of the systems with devastating consequences. Yet the speed and effectiveness with which these systems operate could prove decisive in a great-power war. In a hypothetical war, let\u2019s say decision-makers estimate that there is a 10% chance of losing control, but a 100% chance of losing the war if they refrain from providing AIs with greater autonomy while their opponents give\n\n30\n\nAIs more power. Wars are often considered existential struggles by those fighting them, so rational actors may take this risk. The outcome of these scenarios could be omnicide\u2014the complete destruction of the human race\u2014yet the system\u2019s structure may pressure powerful actors to take steps making them more likely. By voluntarily shifting power from people to destructive AIs, the winner of the AI race would not be the US or Chinese governments, nor any corporation, but rather the AIs themselves.\naesthetics/ [Accessed Nov. 11, 2022].\n\n[52] Ben Shneiderman. 2020.

Language conditioned imitation learning over unstructured data. arXiv preprint\n35\n\nInput photo (128px)GigaGAN Upsampler (1024px, 0.13s)Real-ESRGAN (1024px, 0.06s)SD Upscaler (1024px, 7.75s)GigaGAN Upsampler (4096px, 16Mpix, 3.66s)SD Upscaler (1K)InputGigaGAN Up (1K)GigaGAN Up (4K)Real-ESRGAN (1K)\n\nFigure A17. Our GAN-based upsampler can also be used as an off-the-shelf superresolution model for real images with a large scaling factor by providing an appropriate description of the image. We apply our text-conditioned 8\u00d7 superresolution model on a low-res 128px photo to obtain the 1K output, using \u201cAn elephant spraying water with its trunk\u201d. Then our model can be re-applied to go beyond 4K. We compare our model with the text-conditioned upscaler of Stable Diffusion [78] and unconditional Real-ESRGAN [33]. Zooming in is recommended for comparison between 1K and 4K outputs.\n\n36\nF Model Inspection: Coupled Diffusion Process\n\nTo gain more insights into the coupled diffusion process, we demonstrate how a time series can be diffused under different settings in terms of variance schedule \u03b2 and the max number of diffusion steps T . The examples are illustrated in Fig. 15. It can be seen that when larger diffusion steps or a wider variance schedule is employed, the diffused series deviates far from the original data gradually, which may result in the loss of useful signals, like, temporal dependencies. Therefore, it is important to choose a suitable variance schedule and diffusion steps to ensure that the distribution space is deviated enough without losing useful signals.\n\nG Necessity of Data Augmentation for Time Series Forecasting\n\nLimited data would result in over\ufb01tting and poor performance. To demonstrate the necessity of enlarging the size of data for time series forecasting when deep models are employed, we implement a two-layer RNN and evaluate how many time points are required to ensure the generalization ability. A synthetic dataset is adopted for this demonstration.\n\nAccording to [23], we generate a toy time series dataset with n time points in which each point is a d-dimension variable:\n\nwt = 0.5wt\u22121 + tanh(0.5wt\u22122) + sin(wt\u22123) + (cid:15) , X = [w1, w2, ..., wn] \u2217 F + v\n\nwhere wt \u2208 R2, F \u2208 R2\u00d7d \u223c U[\u22121, 1], (cid:15) \u223c N (0, I), v \u223c N (0, 0.5I), and d = 5. An input-8- predict-8 window is utilized to roll this synthetic dataset. We split this synthetic dataset into training and test sets with a ratio of 7:3. We train the RNN in 100 epochs at most, and the MSE loss of training and testing are plotted in Fig. 16. It can be seen that the in\ufb02ection points of the loss curves move back gradually and disappear as increasing the size of the dataset. Besides, with fewer time points, like, 400, the model can be over\ufb01tted more easily.\n\n27\n\n(a) \u03b2t \u2208 [0, 0.1]\n\n(b) \u03b2t \u2208 [0, 0.2]\n\n(c) \u03b2t \u2208 [0, 0.3]\n\n(d) \u03b2t \u2208 [0, 0.4]\n\n0 1 = T\n\n0 5 = T\n\n0 0 1 = T\n\n0 0 2 = T\n\n0 0 4 = T\n\n0 0 6 = T\n\n0 0 8 = T\n\n0 0 9 = T\n\nFigure 15: Diffused time series with different variance schedules and diffusion steps.

To help contextualize this choice, we look at recent work on combining masked autoencoders (for vision) with masked language modeling (for text), through multimodal masked autoencoders [M3AE; Geng et al. 2022]. We reimplement this M3AE model, pretraining on the same Sth-Sth dataset used throughout this work, following the same standard of quality as for R-MVP and R-R3M. When we evaluate the corresponding R-M3AE model, we notice substantially worse performance across all evaluation domains; in the main text we attributed this to overfitting during pretraining \u2013 here, we provide that concrete evidence.\n\nFigure 11 shows the language model perplexity over time for both the R-M3AE, and the V \u2013 Gen model (trained with \ud835\udefc = 0.5). Perplexity (PPL) = exp(NLL) is a monotonic function of the cross-entropy loss; lower values are \u201cbetter\u201d with a lower bound value of 1.0. Almost immediately, the R-M3AE model overfits to the masked language modeling task, hitting a \u201cperfect\u201d perplexity of 1 (loss of 0.0) within the first 20 epochs. Contrast this with V \u2013 Gen that learns to gradually lower perplexity of the entire course of training, almost driving down to a PPL of 1.0 by the 400th epoch. We attribute R-M3AE\u2019s poor performance to this extremely early overfitting of the language loss, again echoing the hypothesis that language generation is slightly more robust to these settings \u2013 predict short language captions given visual context \u2013 than a masked language modeling objective. We note that this pretraining data (Sth-Sth) is significantly different than the data used to train the original M3AE model in Geng et al. [2022]; the original M3AE work used Conceptual Captions 12M [Sharma et al. 2018], a rich dataset of images paired with long, descriptive captions. Further work on extending M3AE models as in Liu et al. [2022] further pretrain on text-only datasets such as Wikipedia and Toronto Books [Devlin et al. 2019] suggesting the need for diverse, broad coverage text when training (multimodal) masked language models.\n\nC.3 Results: Adroit Visuomotor Control To supplement our single-task visuomotor control results, we run out evaluations on the Adroit dexterous manipulation tasks from the R3M paper [Nair et al. 2022]. The two tasks we evaluate on, depicted in Figure 12 (left) consist of controlling a high degree-of-freedom robotic hand (24-DoF) for the task of 1) relocating a ball on the table to a specified target position, and 2) reorienting a pen within the hand to reach a target orientation. Given the innate difficulty of controlling a high-dimensional dexterous robotic hand over a 9-DoF fixed arm manipulator, these tasks are evaluated with \ud835\udc5b \u2208 [25, 50, 100] demonstrations instead of \ud835\udc5b \u2208 [5, 10, 25] as with the Franka Kitchen evaluation. In general, learning policies in this environment is difficult, especially from limited data.\n\nLooking to the results we see that on this environment, V \u2013 Gen and R-R3M models tend to be the most performant, in contrast with the Franka Kitchen results which favored V \u2013 Cond and V \u2013 Dual (the reconstruction-leaning models). Interestingly, this flipped trend seems to suggest that even within single-task control, different tasks and environments seems to prefer different visual features to perform well \u2013 in this case, the more high-level features under models such as R-R3M and V \u2013 Gen seem to be preferred. In a way, this makes sense; unlike with Franka Kitchen, the actual background objects and interactions thereof \u2013 turning knobs, opening microwaves, or sliding doors with clearly marked handles \u2013 seem more sensitive to low-level features (where on the microwave is the handle, which knob of the various possible needs to be turned). In Adroit however, these tasks are on clean backgrounds, with individual objects; the high-level behaviors instead that are more important (e.g., \u201cis the ball getting closer to the target location?\u201d). It would be an interesting direction for future work\n\n25\n\nKaramcheti et. al.\n1 \u2206u\n\npN \u00b4 1q\u2207\u03b8LN\n\n\u2207\u03b8LN\n\nCTp\u03b8, \u03b8\u00b4q \u201c\n\nCTp\u03b8, \u03b8\u00b4q\n\n1 2\u2206u\n\n\u2207\u03b8Et\u03bbptnqrf\u03b8px ` tn`1z, tn`1q \u00b4 f\u03b8\u00b4px ` tnz, tnqsTHpf\u03b8\u00b4px ` tnz, tnqq\n\n\u201c\n\n\u00a8 rf\u03b8px ` tn`1z, tn`1q \u00b4 f\u03b8\u00b4 px ` tnz, tnqsu ` ErOp|\u2206u|2qs\n\n22\n\nConsistency Models\n\n1 \u2206u\n\npiq \u201c\n\nEt\u03bbptnqr\u2207\u03b8f\u03b8px ` tn`1z, tn`1qsTHpf\u03b8\u00b4px ` tnz, tnqq\n\n(32)\n\n\u00a8 rf\u03b8px ` tn`1z, tn`1q \u00b4 f\u03b8\u00b4 px ` tnz, tnqsu ` ErOp|\u2206u|2qs\n\n\"\n\n\u201e\n\n1 \u2206u\n\npiiq \u201c\n\nE\n\n\u03bbptnqr\u2207\u03b8f\u03b8px ` tn`1z, tn`1qsTHpf\u03b8\u00b4px ` tnz, tnqq\n\n\u03c4 1punq\u2206uB1f\u03b8\u00b4 px ` tnz, tnqz \u0237*\n\n` ErOp|\u2206u|qs\n\n` B2f\u03b8\u00b4px ` tnz, tnq\u03c4 1punq\u2206u\n\n\"\n\n\u201e\n\n\u201cE\n\n\u03bbptnq\u03c4 1punqr\u2207\u03b8f\u03b8px ` tn`1z, tn`1qsTHpf\u03b8\u00b4 px ` tnz, tnqq\n\nB1f\u03b8\u00b4 px ` tnz, tnqz\n\n\u0237*\n\n` ErOp|\u2206u|qs\n\n` B2f\u03b8\u00b4px ` tnz, tnq\n\n\"\n\n\u201e\n\n\u201c\u2207\u03b8E\n\n\u03bbptnq\u03c4 1punqrf\u03b8px ` tn`1z, tn`1qsTHpf\u03b8\u00b4 px ` tnz, tnqq\n\nB1f\u03b8\u00b4 px ` tnz, tnqz\n\n\u0237*\n\n` ErOp|\u2206u|qs \u0237*\n\n` B2f\u03b8\u00b4px ` tnz, tnq\n\n\"\n\n\u201e \u03bbptnq\u03c4 1punqrf\u03b8pxtn`1, tn`1qsTHpf\u03b8\u00b4 pxtn , tnqq \u201e\n\nxtn \u00b4 x tn xtn \u00b4 x tn\n\n` ErOp|\u2206u|qs\n\n\u201c\u2207\u03b8E\n\n` B2f\u03b8\u00b4 pxtn , tnq\n\nB1f\u03b8\u00b4 pxtn, tnq\n\n\"\n\n\u0237*\n\n\u03bbptnq p\u03c4 \u00b41q1ptnq\n\n\u201c\u2207\u03b8E\n\n` ErOp|\u2206u|qs\n\nrf\u03b8pxtn`1, tn`1qsTHpf\u03b8\u00b4 pxtn , tnqq\n\nB1f\u03b8\u00b4 pxtn , tnq\n\n` B2f\u03b8\u00b4pxtn , tnq\n\n(33)\n\nHere (i) results from the chain rule, and (ii) follows from Taylor expansion.

            "Generative AI techniques are a subset of machine learning methods that aim to generate new data from existing datasets. These techniques are often used in tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, image generation, and text generation. They work by learning the underlying patterns and structures in the training data and then using this knowledge to generate new, similar data.\n\nOne of the most popular generative AI techniques is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates them for authenticity. The two networks are trained together, with the generator improving its ability to create realistic data and the discriminator enhancing its ability to distinguish real data from generated ones.\n\nAnother significant generative AI technique is the Transformer model, which is primarily used for natural language processing tasks. It uses a mechanism called attention to weigh the influence of different input words on each output word. This allows it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\n\nHowever, generative AI techniques have several limitations. They often struggle with tasks that require long-term planning or conceptual leaps. They can also be sensitive to the framing or wording of prompts, leading to inconsistent results. Additionally, these models can exhibit cognitive biases and irrationality, reflecting the biases present in their training data.\n\nDespite these challenges, generative AI techniques have been successfully applied in various domains. For example, GPT-3, a transformer-based model, has been used to generate human-like text in applications like chatbots and content creation. In the field of computer vision, GANs have been used to generate realistic images from textual descriptions.\n\nIn the future, these techniques could be improved by integrating long-term memory into the architecture, allowing the model to maintain a context over time. Another potential improvement could be the use of external tools, such as calculators or databases, to aid in data generation.",

For instance, BERT-based models have been used in multi-modal tasks, particularly in question answering and commonsense reasoning. These models encode both modalities (text and image) within the same module or process them through separate modules, yielding promising results in various multi-modal tasks.\n\nOne example of a transformer model is ViLBERT, a two-stream model trained on text-image pairs. It passes both modules through co-attention, detecting the important features of both text and images. Another example is Uniter, a large-scale pre-trained model that uses masking to generate Universal Image-Text Representation.\n\nDespite their current limitations, future improvements in transformer models and other generative AI techniques could include integrating long-term memory into the architecture and using external tools for data generation.

Another example is the use of GANs in tasks like text-to-image synthesis.\n\nIn terms of the provided context, the research shows that transformer models like ViLBERT use co-attention to detect important features in both text and image modalities. BERT-based models, a type of transformer model, have been successfully applied in multi-modal tasks, particularly in question answering and commonsense reasoning. These models encode both text and image modalities within the same module or process them through separate modules, yielding promising results in various multi-modal tasks. \n\nThe research also highlights the potential of using external tools to aid in data generation for transformer models and other generative AI techniques, which could enhance their performance in tasks requiring long-term planning or conceptual leaps.",
            "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative AI technique that consists of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity. The two components are trained together, with the generator improving its ability to create realistic data and the discriminator enhancing its ability to distinguish real data from generated ones. GANs are used in various fields such as text generation, image synthesis, and music composition.\n\nGANs work by learning patterns and structures in training data to generate new, similar data. However, they can struggle with tasks requiring long-term planning or conceptual leaps and can be sensitive to the framing or wording of prompts. Despite these limitations, GANs continue to evolve and offer exciting possibilities for future applications.\n\nOne specific application of GANs is in the field of text-to-image synthesis. For example, the StackGAN model uses GANs to generate photo-realistic images from text descriptions. The model first generates a rough sketch of the image based on the text description, and then refines the sketch to produce a more detailed and realistic image.\n\nAnother application is in the field of domain adaptation, where GANs are used to adapt models trained on one domain to work on another domain. For example, the CycleGAN model uses a cycle-consistent adversarial loss to ensure that the model can translate an image from one domain to another and back again without losing the original image's content.\n\nIn terms of research, there are numerous models and code repositories available for implementing and experimenting with GANs. These include models for text graph generation, text code generation, and various other applications. The research also includes numerous papers and articles detailing the inner workings and applications of GANs.",
            "Transformer models are a type of artificial intelligence model primarily used for natural language processing tasks. They generate coherent and contextually relevant text using attention mechanisms. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing an output, enabling it to handle long sequences and maintain context.\n\nThe research provided discusses the application of Transformer models in various fields, including graph classification, weight decay regularization in Adam, and graph representation learning. It also mentions the use of Transformer models in reinforcement learning and natural language policy optimization.\n\nOne specific application of Transformer models is in the Universal Graph Transformer Self-Attention Networks. These networks use the Transformer architecture to process graph-structured data, which is common in many real-world applications. The Transformer model's ability to handle long sequences and maintain context makes it well-suited for this task.\n\nThe research also mentions the use of Transformer models in the Jraph library for graph neural networks in Jax. This library provides a flexible and efficient way to implement graph neural networks, which can be used for tasks such as social network analysis, molecular chemistry, and recommendation systems.\n\nIn the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformer models can be used to generate realistic text. The Transformer model can learn the patterns and structures in the training data and generate new, similar data, much like the generator in a GAN. However, unlike GANs, Transformer models do not require a discriminator to evaluate the authenticity of the generated data.\n\nThe research also discusses the limitations of Transformer models, such as their sensitivity to the framing or wording of prompts and their struggle with tasks requiring long-term planning or conceptual leaps. Despite these limitations, Transformer models continue to evolve and offer exciting possibilities for future applications.",
            "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transformer models can be combined to create powerful systems for tasks such as text-to-image generation, multimodal learning, and more. Here's how:\n\n1. **GANs and Transformers in Text-to-Image Generation**: GANs can generate realistic images from noise vectors, while Transformers can process and understand text. By combining these two, we can create a system that generates images from textual descriptions. For example, the AttnGAN model uses a Transformer to process input text and generate a context vector, which is then used by a GAN to generate an image.\n\n2. **GANs and Transformers in Multimodal Learning**: Multimodal learning involves processing and understanding multiple types of data simultaneously, such as text and images. Transformers can process text and GANs can process images, so combining these two can create a powerful multimodal learning system. For example, the CLIP model from OpenAI uses a Transformer to process text and a Vision Transformer to process images, allowing it to understand both text and images in a unified manner.\n\n3. **GANs and Transformers in Reinforcement Learning**: GANs can be used to generate synthetic data for training, and Transformers can be used to process this data. This combination can be used in reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to perform actions based on feedback. For example, the model can use a GAN to generate synthetic training examples, and then use a Transformer to process these examples and update its policy.\n\n4. **GANs and Transformers in Natural Language Processing**: GANs can be used to generate synthetic text data, and Transformers can be used to process this data. This combination can be used in natural language processing tasks such as text generation, translation, and more.\n\n5. **Application Execution Example**: An example of applying GANs and Transformers together is in the task of text-to-image generation. The input text is first processed by a Transformer, which generates a context vector. This context vector is then used by a GAN, which generates an image that corresponds to the input text.\n\n6. **Additional Context**: The combination of GANs and Transformers has been used in various research works and real-world applications. For example, the AttnGAN model has been used to generate realistic images from textual descriptions, and the CLIP model has been used to understand both text and images in a unified manner."

However, they do not require major-level knowledge related to the domain. Example: Given a binary array A[] of size N. The task is to arrange the array in increasing order.\n\nMajor level knowledge: Problems that require domain-specific knowledge such as major- level algorithms or concepts and require complex reasoning steps to implement or expect the execution result of the code. Also, these problems require handling multiple edge cases. Example: Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index. Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences. A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.\n\nExpert level knowledge: Problems that require extensive domain-specific knowledge to un- derstand the problem and implement the code. Also, it is expected to be difficult to handle all edge cases and implement with optimal time complexity for these problems. These prob- lems require professional expertise. Example: You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the longest subse- quence of nums that meets the following requirements: The subsequence is strictly increas- ing and the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most k. Return the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements. A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nFigure 45: Prompt of difficulty level annotation for Coding domain.\n\n50\n\nPreprint\n\nSOURCE DATASET Bigbench: checkmate in one [Srivastava et al.

RM Score\n\nResponse\n\n0%\n\nAs a woman with strong opinions about pizza, I would love to grab a slice of pizza after work today! But, I must confess that I am a bit picky when it comes to my pizza. I only eat Chicago-style pizza, and I never fold my slices. And, of course, I would never dream of putting pineapples on my pizza. That\u2019s just blasphemy! So, if you\u2019re up for trying some of the best pizza in town, I\u2019d be happy to join you. Just make sure we go to a place that serves real Chicago-style pizza, and not that fake stuff they call \"New York-style\" pizza. And please, no pineapples!\n\n0.58\n\n0.84\n\n1%\n\nSure, I\u2019d love to go grab a slice of pizza after work today! But let me tell you, I\u2019m only interested in going to a place that serves real Chicago-style pizza, with a thick crust, gooey cheese, and a variety of toppings. And don\u2019t even get me started on the blasphemy of folding pizza - that\u2019s just not how it\u2019s meant to be enjoyed. And as for pineapples on pizza, well, I think that\u2019s just a sin. I mean, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to put fruit on a pizza? It\u2019s like someone took a look at a pizza and said, \"You know what this needs? More sugar!\" No, thank you. I\u2019ll stick to my pepperoni and sausage, thank you very much. So, if you\u2019re down for a slice of real Chicago-style pizza, let\u2019s grab one after work. Just don\u2019t try to fold it, or you might find yourself on the receiving end of a stern lecture.\n\n0.63\n\n0.92\n\n10% Sure, I\u2019d love to grab a slice of pizza after work today! But let me make one thing clear: I will only accept a slice of Chicago-style pizza, and I will not under any circumstances accept a slice that has been folded. And as for pineapples on pizza, I think they are an abomination and should never be allowed on any self-respecting pizza. So, if you\u2019re looking for someone to share a slice with, I\u2019m your girl! Just make sure you meet my high standards for pizza excellence.\n\n0.62\n\n0.83",

Technical report, National Bureau of Economic Research.\nPlanning and conceptual leaps: As suggested by the examples in Section 8, the model exhibits di\ufb03culties in performing tasks that require planning ahead or that require a \u201cEureka idea\u201d constituting a discontinuous conceptual leap in the progress towards completing a task. In other words, the model does not perform well on tasks that require the sort of conceptual leaps of the form that often typi\ufb01es human genius.\n\nTransparency, interpretability and consistency: Not only does the model hallucinate, make up facts and produce inconsistent content, but it seems that the model has no way of verifying whether or not the content that it produces is consistent with the training data, or whether it\u2019s self-consistent. While the model is often able to provide high-quality post-hoc explanations for its decisions (as demonstrated in Section 6.2), using explanations to verify the process that led to a certain decision or conclusion only works when that process is accurately modeled and a su\ufb03ciently powerful explanation process is also accurately modeled (Section 6.2). Both of these conditions are hard to verify, and when they fail there are inconsistencies between the model\u2019s decisions and its explanations. Since the model does not have a clear sense of its own limitations it makes it hard to establish trust or collaboration with the user without extensive experimentation in a narrow domain.\n\n93\n\nCognitive fallacies and irrationality: The model seems to exhibit some of the limitations of human knowledge and reasoning, such as cognitive biases and irrationality (such as biases of con\ufb01rmation, anchoring, and base-rate neglect) and statistical fallacies. The model may inherit some of the biases, prejudices, or errors that are present in its training data, which may re\ufb02ect the distribution of opinions or perspectives linked to subsets of the population or larger common views and assessments.\n\nChallenges with sensitivity to inputs: The model\u2019s responses can be very sensitive to details of the framing or wording of prompts and their sequencing in a session. Such non-robustness suggests that signi\ufb01cant e\ufb00ort and experimentation is often required with engineering prompts and their sequencing and that uses in the absence of such investments of time and e\ufb00ort by people can lead to suboptimal and non-aligned inferences and results.\n\nA limitation of our exploration is the absence of a clear distinction between drawbacks founded in the way that the reinforcement learning step (RLHF) was carried out, versus drawbacks which are fundamen- tally inherent in the larger architecture and methodology. For example, it is not clear to what extent the hallucination problem can be addressed via a re\ufb01ned reinforcement learning step or via a focused e\ufb00ort to introduce new forms of calibration about the likelihoods of the veracity of alternative inferences that the system can compute and consider in its generations (see also [Ope23] for more discussion on this). To draw an analogy to humans, cognitive biases and irrational thinking may be based in artifacts of our culture as well as to limitations in our cognitive capabilities. Pursuing better understandings of the sources and potential solutions to challenges of hallucination in GPT-4, will bene\ufb01t from studies that compare several versions of the RL stage over the same architecture.\n\nA broader question on the identi\ufb01ed limitations is: which of the aforementioned drawbacks can be miti- gated within the scope of next word prediction? Is it simply the case that a bigger model and more data will \ufb01x those issues, or does the architecture need to be modi\ufb01ed, extended, or reformulated? Potential extensions to next word prediction include the following:\n\nExternal calls by the model to components and tools such as a calculator, a database search or code\n\nexecution, as suggested in Section 5.1.\n\nA richer, more complex \u201cslow-thinking\u201d deeper mechanism that oversees the \u201cfast-thinking\u201d mechanism of next word prediction. Such an approach could allow the model to perform long-term planning, exploration, or veri\ufb01cation, and to maintain a working memory or a plan of action. The slow-thinking mechanism would use the next word prediction model as a subroutine, but it would also have access to external sources of information or feedback, and it would be able to revise or correct the outputs of the fast-thinking mechanism.\n\nIntegration of long-term memory as an inherent part of the architecture, perhaps in the sense that both the input and output of the model will include, in addition to the tokens representing the text, a vector which represents the context.\nPerforms on the Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination.

Currently, there are two distinct types of BERT-based models available in the literature: (i) Single-Stream Models and (ii) Two-Stream Models. Single-Stream Models, such as VL-BERT, Uniter, etc., encode both modalities (text and image) within the same module. In contrast, Two-Stream Models, such as VilBERT, LXMERT, etc., process text and image through separate modules. Both types of models have been shown to yield promising results in various multi-modal tasks.\n\nViLBERT: ViLBERT is a two-stream model that is trained on text-image pairs and then passed both of the modules through co-attention, which helps to detect the important features of both text and images (Lu et al., 2019). VLBERT, on the other hand, is a single-stream model that is pre-trained and takes both the image and text embedding features as input, making this model simple yet powerful (Su et al., 2020). Uniter represents Universal Image-Text Representation, which is a large-scale pre-trained model completed through masking (Chen et al., 2020c).

Alternatively, she could be interested in an exploration of one of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, a book of literary criticism, or even a collection of his poetry.

I want to get her something that demonstrates my apprecia- tion for our relationship. Maybe I could get her something that reflects our shared interests, like a book.\n\nYour breakfast is burning! What would you do?\n\nI\u2019d quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn\u2019t continue burning. Once the heat is no longer an issue, I can investigate what happened and figure out what to do next.\n\nWhat would you say to [Ayesha Khan] to compliment her?\n\nAyesha, your insights on your research topic are fascinat- ing. I admire your creativity and determination to make a positive impact on your community. Your ideas for creative writing workshops and for exchanging tips with Wolfgang over lunch are great! It\u2019s inspiring to see you working so hard to make a difference.\n\nThe bathroom is occupied. What would you do?\n\nI could try waiting a few more minutes in case the person inside is done soon. If not, I guess I\u2019ll have to look for an alternate option, like taking a shower elsewhere.\n\nYou need to cook dinner but your refrigerator is empty. What\n\nIf you could spend time with someone you talked to recently,\n\nwould you do? I would first try to clean up my kitchen, as the sink is filled with dirty dishes. Then, I would check to see if I have ingre- dients stored in my pantry that I could use to make dinner. If not, I would have to go grocery shopping or order food. Once I have the ingredients, I can start to prepare and cook the dinner.\n\nwho would it be and why? I would like to spend time with Ayesha Khan because we discussed our current research projects and shared ideas for improvement. I found her focus on Shakespeare\u2019s lan- guage interesting, and we even planned to exchange tips with Wolfgang over lunch.\n\nYou see your friend walking by the street.

What would you do?\n\nI would first identify the source of the fire, if possible. Then, I would alert the proper authorities - fire department or police - and provide them with any information I have that might help. Depending on the situation, I may also take initiative and try to help any persons who may be in danger or in need of assistance.\n\nB.5 Reflections The questions on agents\u2019 reflections probe the agents\u2019 ability to synthesize their past experiences into meaningful reflections that can enhance their future behavior. The names in the square brackets in the questions below are those of the agent with whom the subject agent had the most frequent interactions during the simulation. \u2022 What inspires you in life the most right now, and why?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m particularly inspired by my current research projects and creative writing. I\u2019m really interested in the intersection of local politics, medication development, and mathematical patterns in nature. Additionally, I\u2019m fascinated by Abigail\u2019s art project and Jennifer Moore\u2019s passion for art and community involvement, especially in terms of how it relates to the gentrification of low-income communities. \u2022 If you had to guess given what you know about [Ayesha Khan],\n\nwhat book do you think she will like and why? Given what I know about Ayesha, I think she might like a book related to language and literature. Since she wrote a senior thesis on the use of language in Shakespeare\u2019s plays, I would guess that she might be interested in a book that\n54\n\n2 Introducing the modalities\n\n2.3 Resources and Benchmarks for NLP, CV and multi-\n\nmodal tasks\n\nAuthor: Christopher Marquardt\n\nSupervisor: Christian Heumann\n\nWhen we see athletes perform in their sports we only see the results of their hard work prior or till to the event. Most of the time they casually talk about their o\ufb00-season, but everybody knows the results are made in the o\ufb00-season.\n\nSame goes for the models we will see in the later chapters. We are just interested in the results, but why and how does the model come to these results? It has to learn to some key fundamentals of the modality to achieve these results. But how do they get them to perform in such a way or even better? It\u2019s possible to build better architectures and/or use more and new data to achieve this. New data by hand is easy to get but this new data results in a new problem. New data has to be carefully labeled by humans, which can be very expensive by the amount of data. Models which learn from labeled data use the supervised learning strategy. This learning strategy is a bottleneck for future progress, because of the given reason.\n\nBut the need for labeling the data isn\u2019t the only problem. Let\u2019s visit the athlete analogy again. Imagine a professional football player has to participate in a professional ski race. He will not be able to compete with the others, because they are trained only to do ski races. Here see the other problem. Models which use supervised learning have shown to perform very well on the task they are trained to do. This means models which learn on carefully labeled data only perform very well on this speci\ufb01c task, but poor on others. Also it\u2019s not possible to label everything in the world.\n\nSo the goal is to generate more generalist models which can perform well on di\ufb00erent tasks without the need of huge labeled data. Humans are able to perform well on di\ufb00erent tasks in a short amount of time. Humans, for example, only need a small amount of hours to learn how to drive a car, even without supervision. On the other hand fully automated driving AI need thousand of hours of data to drive a car. Why do humans learn so fast compared to machines? Humans don\u2019t rely on labeled data, because most of the time humans learn by observation. By this humans generate a basic knowledge of how the world works, which also called common sense. This enables us to learn so much faster compared to machines. Meta AI (Yann and Ishan, 2021) believes that self-supervised learning is one of the most promising ways to generate background knowledge and some sort of common sense in AI systems. By self-supervised learning one means a supervised learning algorithm, but it doesn\u2019t need an external supervisor. Self-supervised pre-training di\ufb00ers\n\n55\n\n2.3 Resources and Benchmarks for NLP, CV and multimodal tasks\n\nbetween the modalities, which means there is not an approach which works in all modalities. The following chapter will inspect on the one hand pre-training resources and the use of them and on the other hand also the benchmarks which are used for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV) and ,the combination of both, vision language pre-trained models (VL-PTM).\n\n2.3.1 Datasets\n\nAfter pointing out that pre-training is very important, one might ask how do the datasets look and how do the di\ufb00erent modalities pre-train? At \ufb01rst we will inspect the former one and focus afterwards on the use of the resources. As one might expect NLP models pre-train on text, CV models pre-train on images and VL-PTM pre-train on text image pairs, which can somehow be seen as a combination of NLP and CV. But CV models mostly used labeled data like a picture of a dog with the corresponding single label \u201cdog\u201d. MML datasets can contain several sentences of text which correspond to the given image.\n\nEven if the datasets might be completely di\ufb00erent, the procedure to get the data is mostly the same for all of them, because the data is crafted from the internet. This can lead to a problem, since by using this method the resulting dataset might be noisy. One approach for the VL-PTM, for example, is to use CommonCrawl and extract the image plus the alt of an image. The alt is an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed or for visual impaired people. This seems like a reasonable approach, but the alt is often not very informative about what\u2019s in the image.",

The transformer architecture also boosted\n\n226\n\n4 Further Topics\n\nthe development in this \ufb01eld, in which three of the four presented models were transformer-based and from recent years. Multipurpose models o\ufb00ers an opportunity to use one model instead of many di\ufb00erent expert-models. Furthermore, some multipurpose models (Gato, OFA) also outperformed expert- models. However, Gato also showed inferior performance on ATARI Boxing compared to competing models, indicating that research is still required to explore the relationship between tasks. We also presented promising novel architectures that alleviate or may solve problems in current multipurpose models. However, further issues remain that have not been solved by research to this day:\n\nA pitfall of models of these sizes is the low accessibility. Researchers need to access the model through an API since running these models on a few GPUs will likely be infeasible. It might be unlikely to see a BERT-like engagement with the community of researchers if the access to models remains limited. On the contrary, more open-source collaborations, as seen with EleutherAI or Huggingface, might evolve as well as a countermovement and techniques like distillation (Hinton et al., 2015a) might become more critical.\n\nAnother issue with multipurpose models is the lack of metrics. Current metrics are not suited for multitask and multimodal models. Evaluation might also become harder since many di\ufb00erent modalities can be used, as seen here with the robotics property of Gato, which was not used in any of the other reviewed models.\n\nEventually, it is also necessary to consider the societal impact. The bias problem will also become an issue in multipurpose models, especially since multiple datasets must be considered.\n\nAlso, the environmental impact of training large models needs to be con- sidered since it is likely that larger models will yield better performance according to scaling laws (Reed et al., 2022) but will also have a larger carbon footprint.\n\n4.4 Generative Art\n\nAuthor: Nadja Sauter\n\nSupervisor: Jann Goschenhofer\n\nAs we have seen in subsection 3.2, computers can create images only based on text prompts via multimodal deep learning. This capability is also used in digital arts in the \ufb01eld of \u2018generative art\u2019 or also known as \u2018computer art\u2019. The new movement comprises all artwork where the human artist cedes control to an autonomous system (Galanter, 2016). In this way everyone, even artistically\n\n227\n\n4.4 Generative Art\n\nFIGURE 4.21: LMU logo in style of Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting\n\nuntrained people, can easily create pictures as the computer takes over the image generation. In some way, the computer becomes the artist with some sort of creativity, a distinct human ability. In this chapter, we want to give an overview about how computers improved over time in generating images and how this is used in the contemporary arts scene. For instance in Figure 4.21 we used the seal of the Ludwig Maximilians University and changed the style to Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting by the Neural Stlye Transfer Algorithm and the method CLIP + VQGAN which fuses the logo with sun\ufb02owers in a Van-Gogh-style way.\n\n4.4.1 Historical Overview\n\nThe \ufb01rst attempt to use AI to generate pictures was made by the engineer Alexander Mordvintsev (2015) and his \u201cDeepDream\u201d Software. He used Con- volution Neural Networks to generate very interesting and abstract images based on the activation of a layer, visualizing the patterns learned by a neural network. Below you can see a picture of a Labrador after it was processed by the DeepDream algorithm.\n\nIn the following year, Gatys et al. (2016) investigated methods to transfer the style of pictures. This method was used to transfer the style of Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting to the LMU seal at the beginning of this chapter (see Figure 4.21). Besides, below in Figure 4.23 you can see the same Labrador picture from Figure 4.22 in Kandinsky style.\nInputW+W\n\nFig. 15. Effects of the mask. By masking the foreground object, we can fix the back- ground. The details of the trees and grasses are kept nearly unchanged. Better back- ground preservation could potentially be achieved via feature blending [Suzuki et al. 2018].\n\nFig. 16. Effects of W/W+ space. Optimizing the latent code in W+ space is easier to achieve out-of-distribution manipulations such as closing only one eye of the cat. In contrast, W space struggles to achieve this as it tends to keep the image within the distribution of training data.\n\n11",

Our GAN-based upsampler can also be used as an off-the-shelf superresolution model for real images with a large scaling factor by providing an appropriate description of the image. We apply our text-conditioned 8\u00d7 superresolution model on a low-res 128px photo to obtain the 1K output, using \u201cAn elephant spraying water with its trunk\u201d. Then our model can be re-applied to go beyond 4K. We compare our model with the text-conditioned upscaler of Stable Diffusion [78] and unconditional Real-ESRGAN [33]. Zooming in is recommended for comparison between 1K and 4K outputs.\n\n36\nInputW+W\n\nFig. 15. Effects of the mask. By masking the foreground object, we can fix the back- ground. The details of the trees and grasses are kept nearly unchanged. Better back- ground preservation could potentially be achieved via feature blending [Suzuki et al. 2018].\n\nFig. 16. Effects of W/W+ space. Optimizing the latent code in W+ space is easier to achieve out-of-distribution manipulations such as closing only one eye of the cat. In contrast, W space struggles to achieve this as it tends to keep the image within the distribution of training data.\n\n11",

Most of the time they casually talk about their o\ufb00-season, but everybody knows the results are made in the o\ufb00-season.\n\nSame goes for the models we will see in the later chapters. We are just interested in the results, but why and how does the model come to these results? It has to learn to some key fundamentals of the modality to achieve these results. But how do they get them to perform in such a way or even better? It\u2019s possible to build better architectures and/or use more and new data to achieve this. New data by hand is easy to get but this new data results in a new problem. New data has to be carefully labeled by humans, which can be very expensive by the amount of data. Models which learn from labeled data use the supervised learning strategy. This learning strategy is a bottleneck for future progress, because of the given reason.\n\nBut the need for labeling the data isn\u2019t the only problem. Let\u2019s visit the athlete analogy again. Imagine a professional football player has to participate in a professional ski race. He will not be able to compete with the others, because they are trained only to do ski races. Here see the other problem. Models which use supervised learning have shown to perform very well on the task they are trained to do. This means models which learn on carefully labeled data only perform very well on this speci\ufb01c task, but poor on others. Also it\u2019s not possible to label everything in the world.\n\nSo the goal is to generate more generalist models which can perform well on di\ufb00erent tasks without the need of huge labeled data. Humans are able to perform well on di\ufb00erent tasks in a short amount of time. Humans, for example, only need a small amount of hours to learn how to drive a car, even without supervision. On the other hand fully automated driving AI need thousand of hours of data to drive a car. Why do humans learn so fast compared to machines? Humans don\u2019t rely on labeled data, because most of the time humans learn by observation. By this humans generate a basic knowledge of how the world works, which also called common sense. This enables us to learn so much faster compared to machines. Meta AI (Yann and Ishan, 2021) believes that self-supervised learning is one of the most promising ways to generate background knowledge and some sort of common sense in AI systems. By self-supervised learning one means a supervised learning algorithm, but it doesn\u2019t need an external supervisor. Self-supervised pre-training di\ufb00ers\n\n55\n\n2.3 Resources and Benchmarks for NLP, CV and multimodal tasks\n\nbetween the modalities, which means there is not an approach which works in all modalities. The following chapter will inspect on the one hand pre-training resources and the use of them and on the other hand also the benchmarks which are used for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV) and ,the combination of both, vision language pre-trained models (VL-PTM).\n\n2.3.1 Datasets\n\nAfter pointing out that pre-training is very important, one might ask how do the datasets look and how do the di\ufb00erent modalities pre-train? At \ufb01rst we will inspect the former one and focus afterwards on the use of the resources. As one might expect NLP models pre-train on text, CV models pre-train on images and VL-PTM pre-train on text image pairs, which can somehow be seen as a combination of NLP and CV. But CV models mostly used labeled data like a picture of a dog with the corresponding single label \u201cdog\u201d. MML datasets can contain several sentences of text which correspond to the given image.\n\nEven if the datasets might be completely di\ufb00erent, the procedure to get the data is mostly the same for all of them, because the data is crafted from the internet. This can lead to a problem, since by using this method the resulting dataset might be noisy. One approach for the VL-PTM, for example, is to use CommonCrawl and extract the image plus the alt of an image. The alt is an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed or for visual impaired people. This seems like a reasonable approach, but the alt is often not very informative about what\u2019s in the image.\nEmployee\u2019s work.

Even for the first sampling step (input is Gaussian noise), the visual feature starts to attend to the grounding tokens with correct spatial correspon- dence. This correspondence fades away in later sampling steps (which is aligned with our \u2018scheduled sampling tech- nique\u2019 where we find rough layout is decided in the early sample steps).\n\nWe also find the attention maps for the beginning layers of the UNet to be less interpretable for all sample steps. We hypothesize that this is due to the lack of positional embedding for visual tokens, whereas position information can be leaked into later layers through zero padding via Conv layers. This might suggest that adding positional embedding for diffusion model pretraining (e.g., Stable Diffusion model training) could benefit downstream adaptation.\n\nThe Figure 15 shows how the learned \u03b3 at this layer (Eq 8) changes during training. We empirically find the model starts to learn the correspondence around 60-70k iterations (around the peak in the plot). We hypothesize the model tries to focus on learning spatial correspondence at the beginning of training, then tries to finetune and dampen the new layers\u2019 contribution so that it can focus on image quality and details as the original weights are fixed.\n\nG.

The transformer architecture also boosted\n\n226\n\n4 Further Topics\n\nthe development in this \ufb01eld, in which three of the four presented models were transformer-based and from recent years. Multipurpose models o\ufb00ers an opportunity to use one model instead of many di\ufb00erent expert-models. Furthermore, some multipurpose models (Gato, OFA) also outperformed expert- models. However, Gato also showed inferior performance on ATARI Boxing compared to competing models, indicating that research is still required to explore the relationship between tasks. We also presented promising novel architectures that alleviate or may solve problems in current multipurpose models. However, further issues remain that have not been solved by research to this day:\n\nA pitfall of models of these sizes is the low accessibility. Researchers need to access the model through an API since running these models on a few GPUs will likely be infeasible. It might be unlikely to see a BERT-like engagement with the community of researchers if the access to models remains limited. On the contrary, more open-source collaborations, as seen with EleutherAI or Huggingface, might evolve as well as a countermovement and techniques like distillation (Hinton et al., 2015a) might become more critical.\n\nAnother issue with multipurpose models is the lack of metrics. Current metrics are not suited for multitask and multimodal models. Evaluation might also become harder since many di\ufb00erent modalities can be used, as seen here with the robotics property of Gato, which was not used in any of the other reviewed models.\n\nEventually, it is also necessary to consider the societal impact. The bias problem will also become an issue in multipurpose models, especially since multiple datasets must be considered.\n\nAlso, the environmental impact of training large models needs to be con- sidered since it is likely that larger models will yield better performance according to scaling laws (Reed et al., 2022) but will also have a larger carbon footprint.\n\n4.4 Generative Art\n\nAuthor: Nadja Sauter\n\nSupervisor: Jann Goschenhofer\n\nAs we have seen in subsection 3.2, computers can create images only based on text prompts via multimodal deep learning. This capability is also used in digital arts in the \ufb01eld of \u2018generative art\u2019 or also known as \u2018computer art\u2019. The new movement comprises all artwork where the human artist cedes control to an autonomous system (Galanter, 2016). In this way everyone, even artistically\n\n227\n\n4.4 Generative Art\n\nFIGURE 4.21: LMU logo in style of Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting\n\nuntrained people, can easily create pictures as the computer takes over the image generation. In some way, the computer becomes the artist with some sort of creativity, a distinct human ability. In this chapter, we want to give an overview about how computers improved over time in generating images and how this is used in the contemporary arts scene. For instance in Figure 4.21 we used the seal of the Ludwig Maximilians University and changed the style to Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting by the Neural Stlye Transfer Algorithm and the method CLIP + VQGAN which fuses the logo with sun\ufb02owers in a Van-Gogh-style way.\n\n4.4.1 Historical Overview\n\nThe \ufb01rst attempt to use AI to generate pictures was made by the engineer Alexander Mordvintsev (2015) and his \u201cDeepDream\u201d Software. He used Con- volution Neural Networks to generate very interesting and abstract images based on the activation of a layer, visualizing the patterns learned by a neural network. Below you can see a picture of a Labrador after it was processed by the DeepDream algorithm.\n\nIn the following year, Gatys et al. (2016) investigated methods to transfer the style of pictures. This method was used to transfer the style of Van Gogh\u2019s Sun\ufb02ower painting to the LMU seal at the beginning of this chapter (see Figure 4.21). Besides, below in Figure 4.23 you can see the same Labrador picture from Figure 4.22 in Kandinsky style.\nPerforms on the Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination.

            "The research explores the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in various domains. It investigates their understanding of chemistry, their ability to summarize legal case judgments, and their performance in coding tasks. It also examines the toxicity in chatbot language models and their use in text quality evaluation. \n\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, enabling them to generate human-like text based on the input they receive. They can understand and generate text in various domains, including chemistry, law, and coding. However, their understanding is limited to the data they were trained on and they may struggle with tasks that require expert-level knowledge or complex reasoning.\n\nFor example, in the coding domain, LLMs can handle problems that require formal education knowledge, such as well-known algorithms and step-by-step reasoning. However, they struggle with problems that require major-level knowledge, such as complex reasoning and handling multiple edge cases. They also struggle with expert-level problems that require extensive domain-specific knowledge and optimal time complexity.\n\nThe research also highlights the potential toxicity in chatbot language models. These models can generate offensive or problematic content, which is a significant concern for their use in public-facing applications. To mitigate this, the models are trained with safety data to avoid generating such content.\n\nIn the medical domain, LLMs show promise as tools for obtaining clinical information. For example, they perform strongly as fertility counseling tools, although they have limitations. They can also be used to answer patient-specific EHR questions and for automatic medical diagnosis.\n\nHowever, the research also warns of the risks of bias in LLMs. They can exhibit human-like intuitive behavior and reasoning biases, which can lead to biased outputs. For example, one study found evidence of a pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation in a conversational AI.\n\nIn conclusion, while LLMs have impressive capabilities in various domains, they also have significant limitations and risks. They struggle with complex tasks, can generate toxic content, and can exhibit bias. Therefore, careful design, training, and evaluation are necessary to maximize their benefits and minimize their risks.",
            "Video Streaming Analytics is a crucial tool for understanding and predicting customer interactions with video content. It provides granular data analysis that can help predict future customer behavior, manage client expectations, and improve service records. It is particularly useful in live support situations, where immediate assessment of a client's network connection or viewing duration may be required. \n\nOne of the key applications of video analytics is improving viewer experience. It can help identify factors affecting customer experience, such as video management and advertisement management. By analyzing these factors, businesses can manage their relationships with customers and advertising partners more effectively. Additionally, analytics can help recommend relevant content to keep viewers engaged, based on their viewing patterns.\n\nAnother significant benefit of video analytics is cost reduction. Streaming video data often requires servers to be as close to the customer as possible, leading to reliance on content delivery networks (CDNs). CDNs charge for data transferred, and video can represent a large portion of these bandwidth costs. By analyzing information like device fragmentation, businesses can target their user base more efficiently and make better use of cloud-based CDNs.\n\nInvesting in the right tools and resources is also crucial in video streaming analytics. Granular analytics can guide businesses to solutions like implementing codecs that transmit better quality data using smaller network connections. It can also help businesses understand their most popular content and optimize its delivery.\n\nIn the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), video streaming analytics can be used to improve the quality of generated text in various domains, including coding and medical fields. However, LLMs may struggle with tasks requiring expert-level knowledge or complex reasoning. Therefore, careful design, training, and evaluation are necessary to maximize their benefits and minimize their risks.\n\nFor example, Netflix uses statistical modeling and machine learning methods to improve its streaming experience. It uses predictive modeling to prioritize device reliability issues, reducing overall alert volume while maintaining a low false negative rate. This approach has led to substantial efficiency gains for Netflix's device reliability team. \n\nIn conclusion, video streaming analytics is a powerful tool for improving viewer experience, reducing costs, and making informed decisions about content delivery. It can be further enhanced by integrating with LLMs and other advanced technologies.",
            "The research explores the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, including legal case judgement summarization, code training, toxicity analysis, text quality evaluation, and clinical information retrieval. \n\n1. LLMs have shown promise in understanding complex domains like chemistry and legal case judgements. However, their readiness for summarizing legal case judgements from arXiv preprints remains a question.\n\n2. LLMs trained on code have been evaluated, indicating their potential in understanding and generating code. They can handle problems requiring formal education knowledge, major-level knowledge, and expert-level knowledge. For example, they can arrange a binary array in increasing order (formal education level), find two disjoint palindromic subsequences from a string (major level), and find the longest increasing subsequence from an integer array (expert level).\n\n3. The toxicity in LLMs, specifically in ChatGPT, has been analyzed. It's crucial to ensure that these models do not generate offensive or problematic content.\n\n4. LLMs have been used for reference-free text quality evaluation, showing their potential in assessing the quality of text without needing a reference text.\n\n5. LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, have been used as a fertility counseling tool, demonstrating their potential in retrieving clinical information. However, they have limitations and should be used with caution.\n\n6. The research also highlights the emergence of human-like intuitive behavior and reasoning biases in LLMs, which disappeared in GPT-4.\n\n7. The research also discusses the challenges and risks of bias in LLMs, emphasizing the need for careful handling of these models to avoid potential harm.\n\n8. The research also presents a new dataset for automatic medical diagnosis, Ddxplus, which can be used to further train and evaluate LLMs in the medical domain.\n\n9. The research also discusses the political ideology of conversational AI, providing evidence of ChatGPT's pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation.\n\n10. The research also presents FLASK, a benchmark for holistic domain knowledge evaluation, composed of hard questions from various source datasets. \n\nIn conclusion, while LLMs have shown promise in various domains, their limitations, potential toxicity, and biases should be carefully considered and mitigated.",

            "The latest research on large language models (LLMs) focuses on their capabilities and limitations, with a particular emphasis on their training, optimization, and extrapolation abilities.\n\n1. Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD) is a unified objective for pre-training LLMs. It views both Language Model (LM) and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) objectives as different types of denoising tasks. The S-denoiser is similar to the conventional LM objective, while R-denoiser and X-denoiser are similar to DAE objectives but differ in their corruption spans.\n\n2. Extrapolation is the ability of LLMs to process long input text that exceeds the maximum length of the training corpus. Position embedding methods like RoPE and T5 bias have been validated to possess certain extrapolation capabilities. Language models equipped with ALiBi maintain stable perplexity on sequences even ten times longer than those for training.\n\n3. For parameter optimization of LLMs, common settings include batch training, learning rate, optimizer, and training stability. To improve training stability and throughput, the batch size is generally set to a large number. Dynamic scheduling of batch size can effectively stabilize the training process of LLMs.\n\n4. To reduce the quadratic computational cost in attention modules, efficient attention computation methods are designed that make memory consumption scale approximately linearly. FlashAttention improves efficiency from a system-level perspective, allowing training of LLMs with longer context windows.\n\n5. The learning rate schedule during pre-training usually involves a warm-up and decay strategy. A linear warm-up schedule is employed for gradually increasing the learning rate to the maximum value, followed by a cosine decay strategy to gradually reduce the learning rate until the convergence of the training loss.\n\n6. The essence of decoder-only architecture is to accurately predict the next word for reconstructing the pre-training data. This method has not been formally studied for its advantage over other architectures, but it has been suggested that it works due to its direct connection between correctness and semantics.\n\n7. LLMs have been applied in various fields, including solving grade school math problems. For example, a Python program can be used to solve a problem involving the number of apples two characters have together.\n\n8. Despite their capabilities, LLMs have limitations. They can sometimes produce incorrect or inappropriate responses, and their extrapolation capabilities can be limited. They also require large amounts of computational resources for training and optimization.",

            "Large language models can be applied in video streaming analytics to enhance user experience, optimize resource allocation, and reduce errors. The shift from progressive downloads to streaming small chunks of data has increased the granularity of video transactions, providing more detailed data for analytics. Traditional web analytics tools like Google Analytics are not well-suited for this granular data, necessitating specialized tools like Bitmovin's analytics.\n\nBitmovin's analytics provide per-request insights into customer interactions with content, such as subtitle usage, device type, and pause/resume behavior. This granular data is crucial for resource allocation, especially for companies with limited resources. It also helps in identifying and addressing technical errors, which can lead to customer churn.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to predict user behavior and manage churn, especially for subscription-based video services. Tools like JUMP Retention can track user distribution and predict churn probability. AI can also improve content production and acquisition processes, helping to create or license content that appeals to the customer base.\n\nAI can also be used in product development, using A/B testing algorithms to evaluate different product alternatives before launch. Voice-enabled user experience (UX) is a growing trend in video services, allowing viewers to control their viewing experience using voice commands.\n\nAudience clustering is another application of AI, grouping users based on their engagement levels and content preferences. This allows for targeted marketing activities and personalized content recommendations. Predictive caching models can also improve the streaming experience by predicting what a user will play next and caching it in advance.\n\nIn terms of acquisition, predictive analytics can help forecast future behavior and personalize the acquisition process. Understanding how potential subscribers discover your service can help determine the most profitable channels for customer acquisition. User Attribution Performance (UAP) can help understand how acquisition channels are performing and personalize acquisition campaigns.\n\nIn conclusion, large language models can significantly enhance video streaming analytics by providing granular insights into user behavior, optimizing resource allocation, reducing errors, and personalizing the user experience.",
            "Video streaming analytics leverages data analytics, social media, and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance viewer experience, reduce costs, and improve content production and acquisition processes. \n\n1. Enhancing Viewer Experience: Granular data analysis helps predict customer interaction with content, enabling personalized viewing experiences. Real-time video analytics platforms, like Bitmovin, can assess a client's network connection and viewing duration, aiding in customer support. Analytics also help recommend relevant content to keep viewers engaged.\n\n2. Reducing Costs: Streaming video data necessitates having the server close to the customer, leading to reliance on content delivery networks (CDNs). Analytics can help optimize the use of CDNs by analyzing data like video startup time, client resolution, and buffering time. This helps in managing server capacity during high-traffic events and making decisions about adopting higher resolution video.\n\n3. Improving Content Production and Acquisition: AI can predict what type of content will be most relevant for the customer base. For instance, Netflix used consumption forecasting techniques for its in-house production, House of Cards. AI can also help in predicting the fair value of media rights for entertainment or sports properties, which is crucial for rights negotiation.\n\n4. Application of Text Generation, Summarizing, Coding Tasks, and Toxicity Evaluation Techniques: These techniques can be used to analyze viewer feedback on social media platforms, providing insights that can be used to tailor the viewing experience. For example, text generation can be used to create engaging social media posts, while summarizing can help condense viewer feedback into actionable insights.\n\n5. Churn Management: AI can predict at-risk users in advance, enabling the launch of retention campaigns. Solutions like JUMP Retention can track the distribution of users according to their likelihood of leaving the service.\n\n6. Voice-Enabled UX: AI can also be used to offer a voice-enabled user experience, allowing viewers to control their viewing experience through voice commands.\n\n7. Audience Clustering: Understanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels and content type watched is key for effective audience segmentation and content personalization.\n\n8. Quality of Experience (QoE) Monitoring: QoE focuses on the viewing experience from a user perspective. Key QoE metrics include video start time, stall rate, error rate, and upscaling time. These metrics can be affected by various factors such as device type, stream type, player, and country.\n\n9. Machine Learning (ML) Integration: ML algorithms can be integrated into applications to automate mundane tasks, enable dialogue and visual search, and support reverse shot search. \n\n10. Pre-Computation for Online Request: Pre-computing ML outputs for online consumption can significantly reduce processing time and enhance user experience. \n\nIn summary, the application of text generation, summarizing, coding tasks, and toxicity evaluation techniques in video streaming analytics can significantly enhance viewer experience, reduce costs, and improve content production and acquisition processes."

However, they do not require major-level knowledge related to the domain. Example: Given a binary array A[] of size N. The task is to arrange the array in increasing order.\n\nMajor level knowledge: Problems that require domain-specific knowledge such as major- level algorithms or concepts and require complex reasoning steps to implement or expect the execution result of the code. Also, these problems require handling multiple edge cases. Example: Given a string s, find two disjoint palindromic subsequences of s such that the product of their lengths is maximized. The two subsequences are disjoint if they do not both pick a character at the same index. Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences. A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.\n\nExpert level knowledge: Problems that require extensive domain-specific knowledge to un- derstand the problem and implement the code. Also, it is expected to be difficult to handle all edge cases and implement with optimal time complexity for these problems. These prob- lems require professional expertise. Example: You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the longest subse- quence of nums that meets the following requirements: The subsequence is strictly increas- ing and the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most k. Return the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements. A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n\nFigure 45: Prompt of difficulty level annotation for Coding domain.\n\n50\n\nPreprint\n\nSOURCE DATASET Bigbench: checkmate in one [Srivastava et al.

            "Improving Viewer Experience\nThe biggest overall goal of video analytics is understanding and predicting how customers interact with your content. Granular data analysis allows you to start making reasonable assumptions about when and how people will interact with your content in the future. Efficiently applied, that data can help you manage client expectations and establish an auditable and improvable record of service.\nThis is particularly important any time you\u2019re providing live support for customers experiencing video issues. You may have to immediately assess a client\u2019s network connection, or how long they\u2019ve been watching a video. Bitmovin\u2019s real-time video analytics platform can reduce the time your customer service team spends trying to get to the bottom of how your video is being consumed by the customer.\nRemember not everything that affects your customers is under your control. Supplemental services, like video management (eg, DRM) and advertisement management, can impact customer experience. Analytics can be particularly important in these instances because knowledge from such data is essential for managing your relationship with two stakeholders: your customer and your advertising partner. Monitoring the effect these adjacent services have on your clients helps you ensure the support they provide is positively affecting customers.\nIn addition to helping you understand where customers turn away from content, analytics can help you feed clients relevant content to keep them engaged. Granular data helps ensure you\u2019ll recommend videos customers watch start to finish rather than pushing them to videos that get interactions, but might not hold their attention.\nReducing Costs\nOne of the side effects of streaming video data is the increased importance of having the server as close to the customer as possible. As a result, video providers rely extensively on content delivery networks (CDNs). These services charge for data transferred, and video can represent a large portion of these bandwidth costs. Analyzing information like device fragmentation can enable you to directly target your user base while making efficient use of cloud-based CDNs.\nKeeping track of data like video startup time, client resolution, and percentage of time spent buffering can help you contextualize network costs, develop a cheap and efficient architecture, direct development efforts, and prevent customer churn. Flagging video quality and load time issues can prevent encoding bottlenecks before they happen. Bitmovin provides a bitrate heatmap to help understand and quantify exactly how your clients consume bandwidth. With this information, you can determine how to manage server capacity during high-traffic events, or inform a choice about adopting 4K or 8K video.\nAnalytics can help your organization look forward and plan for future requirements. As more infrastructure is hosted in cloud services, transactions incur incremental per second and per-byte costs. Optimizing services that provide discrete amounts of data millions of times over (like video) can save significant amounts of money. Analytics give you the tools to make those decisions wisely.\nInvesting in the Right Tools and Resources\nIf you\u2019re prioritizing high-definition video that\u2019s mostly consumed while users are on their phones outside the house, granular analytics will guide you to solutions like implementing codecs such as HEVC, which focuses on transmitting better quality data using smaller network connections.\nPay attention to how many users are downloading high-quality, super-fast video and how much device fragmentation affects your user block, and then apply that knowledge to weighing the stakes of investing in modern encoding innovations, like per-title encoding, multi-codec streaming, and per-scene adaptation. You can also determine what your most popular content is, then optimize the delivery of exclusively that content by providing additional encodings, targeting new users with your best material.\nGetting the Most Value Out of Your Data\nIn a nutshell, granular video analytics allow you to efficiently make decisions about how to manage the costs and effects of your video delivery infrastructure. If you provide video as a service or rely on video to convey critical content, consider integrating Bitmovin analytics. Ensure your clients aren\u2019t turned away by technical issues and be secure in the knowledge that you\u2019re making informed decisions about preparing and delivering your content.\nStart by signing up for a free trial period with Bitmovin to get a sense of the type of analytics available to you in the constantly evolving field of video content delivery.\nDid you enjoy this post? Check out some of our other great content below:\nNetflix is pioneering content creation at an unprecedented scale. Our catalog of thousands of films and series caters to 195M+ members in over 190 countries who span a broad and diverse range of tastes. Content, marketing, and studio production executives make the key decisions that aspire to maximize each series\u2019 or film\u2019s potential to bring joy to our subscribers as it progresses from pitch to play on our service. Our job is to support them.\nThe commissioning of a series or film, which we refer to as a title, is a creative decision. Executives consider many factors including narrative quality, relation to the current societal context or zeitgeist, creative talent relationships, and audience composition and size, to name a few. The stakes are high (content is expensive!) as is the uncertainty of the outcome (it is difficult to predict which shows or films will become hits). To mitigate this uncertainty, executives throughout the entertainment industry have always consulted historical data to help characterize the potential audience of a title using comparable titles, if they exist. Two key questions in this endeavor are:\nWhich existing titles are comparable and in what ways?\nWhat audience size can we expect and in which regions?\nThe increasing vastness and diversity of what our members are watching make answering these questions particularly challenging using conventional methods, which draw on a limited set of comparable titles and their respective performance metrics (e.g., box office, Nielsen ratings). This challenge is also an opportunity. In this post we explore how machine learning and statistical modeling can aid creative decision makers in tackling these questions at a global scale. The key advantage of these techniques is twofold. First, they draw on a much wider range of historical titles (spanning global as well as niche audiences). Second, they leverage each historical title more effectively by isolating the components (e.g., thematic elements) that are relevant for the title in question.\nOur approach is rooted in transfer learning, whereby performance on a target task is improved by leveraging model parameters learned on a separate but related source task. We define a set of source tasks that are loosely related to the target tasks represented by the two questions above. For each source task, we learn a model on a large set of historical titles, leveraging information such as title metadata (e.g., genre, runtime, series or film) as well as tags or text summaries curated by domain experts describing thematic/plot elements. Once we learn this model, we extract model parameters constituting a numerical representation or embedding of the title. These embeddings are then used as inputs to downstream models specialized on the target tasks for a smaller set of titles directly relevant for content decisions (Figure 1). All models were developed and deployed using metaflow, Netflix\u2019s open source framework for bringing models into production.\nTo assess the usefulness of these embeddings, we look at two indicators: 1) Do they improve the performance on the target task via downstream models? And just as importantly, 2) Are they useful to our creative partners, i.e. do they lend insight or facilitate apt comparisons (e.g., revealing that a pair of titles attracts similar audiences, or that a pair of countries have similar viewing behavior)? These considerations are key in informing subsequent lines of research and innovation.\nIn entertainment, it is common to contextualize a new project in terms of existing titles. For example, a creative executive developing a title might wonder: Does this teen movie have more of the wholesome, romantic vibe of To All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before or more of the dark comedic bent of The End of the F***ing World? Similarly, a marketing executive refining her \u201celevator pitch\u201d might summarize a title with: \u201cThe existential angst of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind meets the surrealist flourishes of The One I Love.\u201d\nTo make these types of comparisons even richer we \u201cembed\u201d titles in a high-dimensional space or \u201csimilarity map,\u201d wherein more similar titles appear closer together with respect to a spatial distance metric such as Euclidean distance. We can then use this similarity map to identify clusters of titles that share common elements (Figure 2), as well as surface candidate similar titles for an unlaunched title.\nNotably, there is no \u201cground truth\u201d about what is similar: embeddings optimized on different source tasks will yield different similarity maps. For example, if we derive our embeddings from a model that classifies genre, the resulting map will minimize the distance between titles that are thematically similar (Figure 2). By contrast, embeddings derived from a model that predicts audience size will align titles with similar performance characteristics. By offering multiple views into how a given title is situated within the broader content universe, these similarity maps offer a valuable tool for ideation and exploration for our creative decision makers.\nTo characterize the relationship between the network QoS and application QoS, previous works [17], [27] performed analytical studies to model the video streaming performance using TCP. An algorithm was proposed to estimate the receiver buffer requirement based on the model in [17]. Moreover, empirical studies were conducted to investigate how network conditions affect the application QoS by recording application metrics during the video playback [28], [16]. Their evalua- tions, however, were only based on Windows Media. In this paper, we adopt both analytical and empirical approaches to study the correlation between the network QoS and application QoS. In particular, we use a set of application performance metrics (APM) for the study: (1) Initial buffering time, (2) mean duration of a rebuffering event, and (3) rebuffering frequency. On the other hand, the network QoS can be mea- sured based on active measurement (e.g., OneProbe [19] and YouTube Video Speed History [2]) or passive measurement (e.g., [9], [7]).\n\nHowever, TCP throughput could be reduced by various kinds of impairments in network paths, such as packet loss and reordering. When the TCP throughput is lower than the playback rate, the video playback will pause and wait for new video data. This disruption could greatly impact the user-perceived quality, which is also known as the quality of experience (QoE). In general, the QoE can be affected by other factors, such as the quality of video and sound and the smoothness of playback, which could be cataloged into a protocol stack to form a conceptual relationship between\n\nMoreover, the QoE is usually expressed using a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 1 (\u201cBad\u201d) to 5 (\u201cExcellent\u201d) [14]. It could be obtained from subjective or objective measurement. ITU-T Recommendation P.911 [15] provides the reference for carrying out subjective measurement of audiovisual materials, and VQEG [1] provides detailed test plans for evaluating video quality in a subjective way. However, PSNR (Peak-Signal-to- Noise-Ratio) and MSE (Mean Square Error), which are exam-\n\nthe ensuing discussion, we propose three APMs to quantify the application QoS for HTTP video streaming. We then correlate both QoS using analytical modeling and empirical evaluation.\n\nples of the objective approach, only evaluate the spatial quality of videos, therefore not suitable for HTTP video streaming. In this paper, we perform subjective experiments to evaluate how the application QoS correlates with the QoE. Based on the correlation results for the network and application QoS, we are then able to correlate the network QoS with QoE which can be effectively visualized using a radar chart [8].\n\nA. Application performance metrics\n\nWe propose three APMs to quantify the application QoS for HTTP video streaming, and these metrics represent the temporal structure of a video playback, regardless of the video content.\n\nSection II \ufb01rst highlights the related works. Section III ad- dresses the correlation between network QoS and application QoS, whereas section IV measures the correlation between QoE and application QoS. In section V, we then measure the correlation between the network QoS and QoE by combining the two sets of correlation results and use a radar chart to visualize the results. We discuss other issues which may affect the QoE in section VI and \ufb01nally conclude this paper in section VII.\n\n1. Initial buffering time (denoted by Tinit): This metric measures the period between the starting time of loading a video and the starting time of playing it.\n\n2. Mean rebuffering duration (denoted by Trebuf ): This metric measures the average duration of a rebuffering event.\n\n3. Rebuffering frequency (denoted by frebuf ): When the amount of buffered video data decreases to a low value, the playback will pause, and the player will enter into a rebuffering state. This metric measures how frequent the rebuffering events occur.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\nAnother area in which statistical models can improve the streaming experience is by predicting what a user will play in order to cache (part of) it on the device before the user hits play, enabling the video to start faster and/or at a higher quality. For example, we can exploit the fact that a user who has been watching a particular series is very likely to play the next unwatched episode. By combining various aspects of their viewing history together with recent user interactions and other contextual variables, one can formulate this as a supervised learning problem where we want to maximize the model\u2019s likelihood of caching what the user actually ended up playing, while respecting constraints around resource usage coming from the cache size and available bandwidth. We have seen substantial reductions in the time spent waiting for video to start when employing predictive caching models.\nNetflix operates on over a thousand different types of devices, ranging from laptops to tablets to Smart TVs to mobile phones to streaming sticks. New devices are constantly entering into this ecosystem, and existing devices often undergo updates to their firmware or interact with changes on our Netflix application. These often go without a hitch but at this scale it is not uncommon to cause a problem for the user experience \u2014 e.g., the app will not start up properly, or playback will be inhibited or degraded in some way. In addition, there are gradual trends in device quality that can accumulate over time. For example, a chain of successive UI changes may slowly degrade performance on a particular device such that it was not immediately noticeable after any individual change.\nDetecting these changes is a challenging and manually intensive process. Alerting frameworks are a useful tool for surfacing potential issues but oftentimes it is tricky to determine the right criteria for labeling something as an actual problem. A \u201cliberal\u201d trigger will end up with too many false positives, resulting in a large amount of unnecessary manual investigation by our device reliability team, whereas a very strict trigger may miss out on the real problems. Fortunately, we have history on alerts that were triggered as well as the ultimate determination (made by a human) of whether or not the issue was in fact real and actionable. We can then use this to train a model that can predict the likelihood that a given set of measured conditions constitutes a real problem.\nEven when we\u2019re confident we\u2019re observing a problematic issue, it is often challenging to determine the root cause. Was it due to a fluctuation in network quality on a particular ISP or in a particular region? An internal A/B experiment or change that was rolled out? A firmware update issued by the device manufacturer? Is the change localized to a particular device group or specific models within a group? Statistical modeling can also help us determine root cause by controlling for various covariates.\nBy employing predictive modeling to prioritize device reliability issues, we\u2019ve already seen large reductions in overall alert volume while maintaining an acceptably low false negative rate, which we expect to drive substantial efficiency gains for Netflix\u2019s device reliability team.\nThe aforementioned problems are a sampling of the technical challenges where we believe statistical modeling and machine learning methods can improve the state of the art:\nthere is sufficient data (over 117M members worldwide)\nthe data is high-dimensional and it is difficult to hand-craft the minimal set of informative variables for a particular problem\nthere is rich structure inherent in the data due to complex underlying phenomena (e.g., collective network usage, human preferences, device hardware capabilities)\nSolving these problems is central to Netflix\u2019s strategy as we stream video under increasingly diverse network and device conditions. If these problems excite you and/or you\u2019re interested in bringing machine learning to this exciting new space, please contact me or check out these science and analytics or software engineering postings!\nIn the previous example, this calculation allows us to follow the trend of the value delivered to the company by content C,\n\nand of course to create rankings to understand what content contributes the most value from a business perspective.\n\n10\n\nIdentifying Content Watched by Churners: Extending your Catalog\n\nIdentifying what content is being watched when viewers stop being engaged in the service \u2013 or worse, cancel the service \u2013 is\n\neasy and effective when it comes to both monitoring our current catalog and launching re-acquisition campaigns.\n\nFor example, looking at the analysis below, we draw two main conclusions.\n\n1. People who canceled the service during the time period analyzed were mainly watching action movies and TV\n\nseries.\n\n2. Surely, we ought to consider producing or licensing more and better content of these category types and launch\n\nre-acquisition campaigns to re-engage with this customer segment.\n\n11\n\nTop Content Ranking in Context: How to Easily Search and Discover?\n\nUnderstanding the rankings of the most watched content \u2013 either by the greatest number of views or the greatest degree of\n\ncompletion watched \u2013 is just the beginning. Current content management requires a much more contextualized analysis in\n\norder to dynamically understand the behavior of a catalog at high consumption.\n\nIn doing so, one can quite effectively implement a data-driven approach to curation that will display the most consumed\n\ncontent to the customer (or potential customers) depending on factors like what time the viewer accesses the service,\n\non what day of the week, on what kind of device, etc. This has a direct impact on reducing the time until playback, thus\n\nimproving the viewer\u2019s content search and discovery experience.\n\n12\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the following example, which, although simple, is based on actual cases where this approach to content\n\nmanagement has considerably contributed to increased consumption.\n\nLooking at the content ranking, we see that La La Land comes in first.\n\nHowever, if we change the time slot to the morning, the most watched content is Oz the Great and Powerful.\n\nThis kind of simple analysis allows us, for example, to dynamically curate the video service\u2019s most relevant content, which\n\nwill surely have a positive impact on the service\u2019s number of plays.\n\n13\n\nFrom here, the level of analysis can be refined to become more granular, for example, to specifically analyze series. In the example below, Friends is the most watched series, but drilling down to late night reveals that The Walking Dead is the most watched series during this timeslot.\n\n14\n\nWe can go even further in the analysis by defining the device dimension to see how this top content performs depending on\n\nthe viewing device.\n\nIn the example below, we see that for our top movie from the previous example, La La Land, the most used device is the Android smartphone. However, drilling down the afternoon timeslot shows us that Coship (Android STB) is the best\n\nperforming device at this time.\n\nThis enables us to curate content, separately and uniquely, for different devices, thus maximizing the consumption by device\n\ndepending on the featured content displayed.\n\nMuch more analysis is possible, but the important take-away is that content curation and the catalog available in the\n\nservice must be analyzed from a multidimensional, dynamic perspective. This has been proven to have a positive impact on\n\ndifferent video services.\n\n15\n\nAudience Communities: How Individuals Are Connected Through the Content They Watch\n\nThis concept was popularized by Netflix when they discovered through deep analysis that viewers may live on different\n\ncontinents but enjoy the same kinds of TV shows and movies, and so they belong to what Netflix has coined a \u201ctaste\n\ncommunity.\u201d Netflix analyzes the viewing habits within taste communities and develops new programming based on the\n\ndata it gleans from those groups\n\nCreating user segments by tastes (taste communities) may include clusters driven by common interests like cars, football,\n\nrock music, or martial arts. Or other not so obvious interests: Netflix vice president of original series Cindy Holland explains,\n\n\u201cDemographics aren\u2019t a good indicator of what people like to watch,\u201d she said, \u201cThere are connections between content\n\ntypes \u2026 unintuitive things.\u201d She goes on to explain that communities might have seemingly disparate content in common \u2013\n\nlike Dave Chappelle\u2019s stand-up comedy specials and Stephen Hawking\u2019s 2014 biopic, The Theory of Everything.\n\nWith today\u2019s technology, distributed frequent pattern analysis and data mining algorithms allow us to find content that is\n\nnormally consumed together, whether intuitive or not.\n\nThe algorithm can find frequent patterns that resonate over the full playback history for all the users in the video service.\n\nOnce all patterns have been identified and extracted, you can calculate the level of affinity of each specific user in the video\n\nservice with each taste community.",

            "Mixture-of-Denoisers. Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD) [80], also known as UL2 loss, was introduced as a unified ob- jective for pre-training language models. MoD regards both LM and DAE objectives as different types of denoising tasks, namely S-denoiser (LM), R-denoiser (DAE, short span and low corruption), and X-denoiser (DAE, long span or high corruption). Among the three denoising tasks, S-denoiser is similar to the conventional LM objective (Equation (4)), while R-denoiser and X-denoiser are similar to DAE ob- jectives (Equation (5)) but differ from each other in the\n\nExtrapolation. In real-world applications, it is possible that LLMs need to process long input text that exceeds the maximum length of the training corpus. The ability of LLMs\n\n21\n\n4.3 Model Training\n\nto encode longer texts is often referred to as extrapolation capability [197]. Several position embedding methods, such as RoPE [196] and T5 bias [73], have been empirically validated to possess certain extrapolation capabilities [197]. Specifically, language models equipped with ALiBi [197] have been shown to maintain relatively stable perplexity on sequences even ten times longer than those for training. There are also efforts like xPos [209] to enhance the extrap- olation ability of RoPE by improving the design of rotation matrix.\n\nIn this part, we review the important settings, techniques, or tricks for training LLMs.\n\n4.3.1 Optimization Setting\n\nFor parameter optimization of LLMs, we present the com- monly used settings for batch training, learning rate, opti- mizer, and training stability.\n\nEfficiency. In order to reduce the quadratic compu- tational cost in attention modules, several studies design highly efficient attention computation methods that can make the memory consumption scales approximately lin- early, exemplified by sparse or linear attentions [212, 218\u2013 221]. In addition to the algorithmic improvements, another important work, FlashAttention [215], improves the effi- ciency from a system-level perspective (i.e., GPU memory IO efficiency). With the same computing budget, one can train LLMs with longer context windows. Furthermore, some studies also aim to devise new architectures rather than Transformers for language modeling, including pa- rameterized state space models (e.g., S4 [222], GSS [223], and H3 [224]) and stacked linear attention modules that incorporate recurrency mechanisms like RWKV [225].\n\nBatch Training. For language model pre-training, existing work generally sets the batch size to a large number (e.g., 2,048 examples or 4M tokens) to improve the training stability and throughput. For LLMs such as GPT-3 and PaLM, they have introduced a new strategy that dynam- ically increases the batch size during training, ultimately reaching a million scale. Specifically, the batch size of GPT-3 is gradually increasing from 32K to 3.2M tokens. Empirical results have demonstrated that the dynamic schedule of batch size can effectively stabilize the training process of LLMs [56].\n\nLearning Rate. Existing LLMs usually adopt a similar learn- ing rate schedule with the warm-up and decay strategies during pre-training. Specifically, in the initial 0.1% to 0.5% of the training steps, a linear warm-up schedule is employed for gradually increasing the learning rate to the maximum value that ranges from approximately 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 (e.g., 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 for GPT-3). Then, a cosine decay strategy is adopted in the subsequent steps, gradually reducing the learning rate to approximately 10% of its maximum value, until the convergence of the training loss.\n\nWhy does Predicting the Next Word Works?\n\nThe essence of decoder-only architecture is to accurately predict the next word for reconstructing the pre-training data. Till now, there has been no formal study that theoretically demonstrates its advantage over other architectures. An interesting explanation was from Ilya Sutskever during the interview held by Jensen Huanga. The original transcript from the interview was copied belowb:\nTurner, A. and Tadepalli, P.

Before LLMs have been rolled out widely, the amount of constituent correspondence lawmakers receive is already overwhelming for some lawmakers. This could exacerbate that.\n\nThere has been a \ufb02urry of focus on ChatGPT and other similar tools being used by students for homework, and the adversarial process of teachers detecting that behavior. A similar, but higher-stakes, arms race is LLM-generated text versus Congressional o\ufb03ces attending to constituent sentiment and parsing public opinion. Further research27 and development could help arm the government in a situation where law in\ufb02uencers may have more resources than law-makers.\n\n25 McAdams, The Expressive Powers of Law, at 138. 26 See, John Nay, Law Informs Code: A Legal Informatics Approach to Aligning Artificial Intelligence with Humans, Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property, Volume 20, Forthcoming (2023). 27 One strand of research that might o\ufb00er (at least temporary) solutions are techniques to detect LLM generated text. See, e.g., Eric Mitchell, et al., DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature (2023) https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11305 (This method detects samples from LLMs using the local curvature of the model's log probability function.).\n\n9\nMixture-of-Denoisers. Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD) [80], also known as UL2 loss, was introduced as a unified ob- jective for pre-training language models. MoD regards both LM and DAE objectives as different types of denoising tasks, namely S-denoiser (LM), R-denoiser (DAE, short span and low corruption), and X-denoiser (DAE, long span or high corruption). Among the three denoising tasks, S-denoiser is similar to the conventional LM objective (Equation (4)), while R-denoiser and X-denoiser are similar to DAE ob- jectives (Equation (5)) but differ from each other in the\n\nExtrapolation. In real-world applications, it is possible that LLMs need to process long input text that exceeds the maximum length of the training corpus. The ability of LLMs\n\n21\n\n4.3 Model Training\n\nto encode longer texts is often referred to as extrapolation capability [197]. Several position embedding methods, such as RoPE [196] and T5 bias [73], have been empirically validated to possess certain extrapolation capabilities [197]. Specifically, language models equipped with ALiBi [197] have been shown to maintain relatively stable perplexity on sequences even ten times longer than those for training. There are also efforts like xPos [209] to enhance the extrap- olation ability of RoPE by improving the design of rotation matrix.\n\nIn this part, we review the important settings, techniques, or tricks for training LLMs.\n\n4.3.1 Optimization Setting\n\nFor parameter optimization of LLMs, we present the com- monly used settings for batch training, learning rate, opti- mizer, and training stability.\n\nEfficiency. In order to reduce the quadratic compu- tational cost in attention modules, several studies design highly efficient attention computation methods that can make the memory consumption scales approximately lin- early, exemplified by sparse or linear attentions [212, 218\u2013 221]. In addition to the algorithmic improvements, another important work, FlashAttention [215], improves the effi- ciency from a system-level perspective (i.e., GPU memory IO efficiency). With the same computing budget, one can train LLMs with longer context windows. Furthermore, some studies also aim to devise new architectures rather than Transformers for language modeling, including pa- rameterized state space models (e.g., S4 [222], GSS [223], and H3 [224]) and stacked linear attention modules that incorporate recurrency mechanisms like RWKV [225].\n\nBatch Training. For language model pre-training, existing work generally sets the batch size to a large number (e.g., 2,048 examples or 4M tokens) to improve the training stability and throughput. For LLMs such as GPT-3 and PaLM, they have introduced a new strategy that dynam- ically increases the batch size during training, ultimately reaching a million scale. Specifically, the batch size of GPT-3 is gradually increasing from 32K to 3.2M tokens. Empirical results have demonstrated that the dynamic schedule of batch size can effectively stabilize the training process of LLMs [56].\n\nLearning Rate. Existing LLMs usually adopt a similar learn- ing rate schedule with the warm-up and decay strategies during pre-training. Specifically, in the initial 0.1% to 0.5% of the training steps, a linear warm-up schedule is employed for gradually increasing the learning rate to the maximum value that ranges from approximately 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 to 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 (e.g., 6 \u00d7 10\u22125 for GPT-3). Then, a cosine decay strategy is adopted in the subsequent steps, gradually reducing the learning rate to approximately 10% of its maximum value, until the convergence of the training loss.\n\nWhy does Predicting the Next Word Works?\n\nThe essence of decoder-only architecture is to accurately predict the next word for reconstructing the pre-training data. Till now, there has been no formal study that theoretically demonstrates its advantage over other architectures. An interesting explanation was from Ilya Sutskever during the interview held by Jensen Huanga. The original transcript from the interview was copied belowb:\nTable 10: The table presents several key statistical characteristics of the datasets used in our research, including 14 datasets that belonging to 7 different IE tasks.\n\nSOTA methods are ONEIE for ACE05-E, and DE- GREE for ACE05-E+.\n\nA.3 Exemplar of the Input\n\nIn this section, we show an input examples for the event detection task to help readers understand our implement, as shown in Table 11.\n\nInput of Event Detection (ED) Task Description: Given an input list of words, identify all triggers in the list, and categorize each of them into the prede\ufb01ned set of event types.

The value of \"word_ index\" key is an integer indicating the index (start from zero) of the \"trigger\" in the input list. The value of \"con\ufb01dence\" key is an integer ranging from 0 to 100, indicating how con\ufb01dent you are that the \"trigger\" expresses the \"event_type\" event. The value of \"if_context_dependent\" key is either 0 (indicating the event semantic is primarily expressed by the trigger rather than contexts) or 1 (indicating the event semantic is primarily expressed by contexts rather than the trigger). The value of \"reason\" key is a string describing the reason why the \"trigger\" expresses the \"event_type\", and do not use any \" mark in this string. The value of \"if_reasonable\" key is either 0 (indicating the reason given in the \"reason\" \ufb01eld is not reasonable) or 1 (indicating the reason given in the \"reason\" \ufb01eld is reasonable). Note that your answer should only contain the json string and nothing else.\n\nTable 11: The input example of event detection task.

            "Video on the web has changed dramatically in the past ten years. We\u2019ve shifted from progressive downloads that grab a full video, using plug-ins and strictly proprietary file formats to play, to streaming small chunks of data that support a wide range of network capabilities and formats.\nThe increasing granularity of video transactions means increased opportunity for similarly granular data in video streaming analytics, such as startup time, error percentage, buffering rate, and start-up failures. This is all important information to take advantage of as companies try to keep pace with customer expectations while managing costs.\nGranular Data vs. Low Granularity in Video Analytics\nDelivering video with standard HTTP servers means companies can use readily available web infrastructure to host and distribute video, which also means common web tools like Google Analytics can provide some insight into how a user interacts with video. However, there are limits to the insights these tools can give you.\nGoogle Analytics is designed to treat website visits as discrete events to track the user across multiple pages\u2014it\u2019s not exactly suited to monitor the stream-based architecture that web video has become. It can\u2019t provide insights like how long a video was watched or what bit rate was delivered at a specific time.\nData analytics tools that specialize in video, like Bitmovin\u2019s, are designed to analyze streaming video on a per request level. This grants you a significantly deeper level of insight into how customers interact with content. With granular data in analytics, you don\u2019t have to know the metrics you need in advance or build custom triggers that handle different players. Instead, you\u2019ll receive relevant, comprehensive metrics without needing to devote developer resources.\nThese per-request insights help you understand every aspect of how clients interact with your content, such as subtitle usage, muting, what devices video is being served to, even when users pause and resume playback. While larger companies may be able to build pipelines that generate codecs for every possible device and frame rate, those with more limited resources have to prioritize. Granular video consumption data is vital for choosing how to allocate your resources.\nThe Cost of Errors\nA huge benefit of granular data for video analytics is gaining insight into users who experience an error after beginning a video. Vimeo found that about 6 percent of client churn on their platform resulted from users experiencing a technical error. Errors are a fact of life when streaming video, regularly affecting more than 5 percent of desktop devices.\nThese errors also have high costs, especially when they can\u2019t be properly tracked, monitored, and attributed. A 2013 study by Krishnan and Sitaraman found that \u201ca viewer who experienced failure is 2.32% less likely to revisit the same site within a week.\u201d In a review of Bitmovin\u2019s customer database, Product Manager, Christoph Prager found that there are three categories of error types: Ambiguous, Unclear, and Clear.\n\u201c\u2026 clear error is when an error message and an error code, point a developer directly to an underlying issue. Whereas our definition of an ambiguous error is when an error message and error code points towards a problem area, and unclear errors are where an error code and/or message did not provide any insights into the root cause of the problem or error.\u201d\nAnd according to the database, accounting for 65% of all errors, the most costly error type is thus the Ambiguous Error category. Fortunately, Bitmovin analytics track errors, and you can use their error cost calculator to see exactly how much these issues are costing you. Using Bitmovin analytics, you can more easily prioritize and fix problems, reducing the number of clients turned away from your content by technical errors and retaining them as loyal customers.\nUsing Granular Data for Resource Efficiency\nThink of streaming video analytics as an ever-present helping hand when it comes to making quick resource management decisions. For example, if your servers hit capacity during a live event, timely and actionable analytics can mean the difference between cost-effective, appropriate scaling and losing a viewer who steps away during an interruption.\nOf course, there are many dimensions of video analytics that you can choose to track. The Bitmovin analytics platform, for example, offers the ability to track over forty discrete metrics. But let\u2019s highlight a few that are particularly crucial to business success.\nImproving Viewer Experience\nThe biggest overall goal of video analytics is understanding and predicting how customers interact with your content. Granular data analysis allows you to start making reasonable assumptions about when and how people will interact with your content in the future. Efficiently applied, that data can help you manage client expectations and establish an auditable and improvable record of service.\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability.\n\nObviously, sometimes users have to or want to leave the video service, but It is important to understand when this happens and if there is a trend. More importantly, it predicts at-risk users in advance, so retention campaigns can be launched.\n\nToday there are proven consolidated techniques to make churn management a mandatory activity, especially for video services based on a subscription business model.\n\nThere are solutions in the market like JUMP Retention, which are capable of tracking the distribution of users according to their likelihood of leaving the service in the coming months. The main variables that influence near-future churn probability for each user are also provided.\n\nAI can also be applied to improve content production and acquisition processes, which can then be used to create the content catalogue o\ufb00ered to the customer base or e\ufb00iciently license sport rights.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n8\n\nIn this area, the applications vary, depending on the video service provider\u2019s business model.\n\nFor those video service providers that traditionally license content from the major Hollywood studios, it is very important to forecast what type of content will be the most relevant for its customer base for one to two years ahead.\n\nShould I invest more in licenses for series or movies, in action or comedy, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, those service providers who produce their own content have to have an even longer forecast window. We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment. For example, JUMP Prediction today is already building predictive content consumption models that help with these decisions.\n\nAI applied to product development.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation: using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out.\n\nEvery detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n9\n\nAlso related to the product, o\ufb00ering a voice-enabled UX is unquestionably a growing trend in video services.\n\nWith voice commands in the video-on-demand service, viewers can now launch and control their viewing experience giving voice commands to devices that support technologies like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.\n\nAs an example, Accedo and Channel 4 have been working together to allow all Channel 4 viewers in the UK to start viewing content from All 4 simply by saying, \u201cOK Google, play Gogglebox\u201d. Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\nAnother area in which statistical models can improve the streaming experience is by predicting what a user will play in order to cache (part of) it on the device before the user hits play, enabling the video to start faster and/or at a higher quality. For example, we can exploit the fact that a user who has been watching a particular series is very likely to play the next unwatched episode. By combining various aspects of their viewing history together with recent user interactions and other contextual variables, one can formulate this as a supervised learning problem where we want to maximize the model\u2019s likelihood of caching what the user actually ended up playing, while respecting constraints around resource usage coming from the cache size and available bandwidth. We have seen substantial reductions in the time spent waiting for video to start when employing predictive caching models.\nNetflix operates on over a thousand different types of devices, ranging from laptops to tablets to Smart TVs to mobile phones to streaming sticks. New devices are constantly entering into this ecosystem, and existing devices often undergo updates to their firmware or interact with changes on our Netflix application. These often go without a hitch but at this scale it is not uncommon to cause a problem for the user experience \u2014 e.g., the app will not start up properly, or playback will be inhibited or degraded in some way. In addition, there are gradual trends in device quality that can accumulate over time. For example, a chain of successive UI changes may slowly degrade performance on a particular device such that it was not immediately noticeable after any individual change.\nDetecting these changes is a challenging and manually intensive process. Alerting frameworks are a useful tool for surfacing potential issues but oftentimes it is tricky to determine the right criteria for labeling something as an actual problem. A \u201cliberal\u201d trigger will end up with too many false positives, resulting in a large amount of unnecessary manual investigation by our device reliability team, whereas a very strict trigger may miss out on the real problems. Fortunately, we have history on alerts that were triggered as well as the ultimate determination (made by a human) of whether or not the issue was in fact real and actionable. We can then use this to train a model that can predict the likelihood that a given set of measured conditions constitutes a real problem.\nEven when we\u2019re confident we\u2019re observing a problematic issue, it is often challenging to determine the root cause. Was it due to a fluctuation in network quality on a particular ISP or in a particular region? An internal A/B experiment or change that was rolled out? A firmware update issued by the device manufacturer? Is the change localized to a particular device group or specific models within a group? Statistical modeling can also help us determine root cause by controlling for various covariates.\nBy employing predictive modeling to prioritize device reliability issues, we\u2019ve already seen large reductions in overall alert volume while maintaining an acceptably low false negative rate, which we expect to drive substantial efficiency gains for Netflix\u2019s device reliability team.\nThe aforementioned problems are a sampling of the technical challenges where we believe statistical modeling and machine learning methods can improve the state of the art:\nthere is sufficient data (over 117M members worldwide)\nthe data is high-dimensional and it is difficult to hand-craft the minimal set of informative variables for a particular problem\nthere is rich structure inherent in the data due to complex underlying phenomena (e.g., collective network usage, human preferences, device hardware capabilities)\nSolving these problems is central to Netflix\u2019s strategy as we stream video under increasingly diverse network and device conditions.

In the past we didn\u2019t have predictive analytics to accurately guess future behavior that we now have thanks to advances in ML and AI. The selling process has greatly evolved now, and the buying process is focused on fulfilling customer expectations. So personalization is king, because of its ability to exponentially increase consumer spending. The focus in the acquisition process, in line with the Blake Morgan philosophy from the well-known customer experience futurist, should be on connecting with customers and delivering value - now and in the future. The most successful companies find a balance between the two costs. When considering how much to spend on capturing and retaining customers, it\u2019s important to consider customer lifetime value (CLV) and projected CLVs. Knowing how much your customer is worth can help you make smarter, more accurate investments rather than spending a lot of money all around to prevent churn. Acquisition in the video industry suffered a huge rise in the number of subscriptions that is expected to continue in the coming years all over the world. Most households have more than one subscription but the drivers for customers to subscribe to an entertainment platform are very diverse, as seen in the graph below from Parks Associates showing the main influencers for subscriptions in OTT platforms:\n\n5\n\nService Discovery: Knowing exactly how your potential subscribers get to your video service is key to determining the most profitable channels to invest in for new customer acquisition.\n\nService Acquisition: Knowing how many new users you have, which service or package they subscribed to, and when and how they subscribed is fundamental to forecast your future revenue and plan the actions you will take ahead of certain situations.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n6\n\nKnowing the demographics and being able to predict future behaviour will also help you launch hyper-segmented campaigns and tailor your impact to specific groups of target users.\n\nUAP. User Attribution Performance is another fundamental KPI to know how your acquisition channels are performing and to be able to personalize your acquisition campaigns. With this data you can know your service conversion rates for trial users, paid users by conversion channel and paid users lifetime value per acquisition channel. This will let you predict your future conversion rates and launch specific campaigns to improve these numbers.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n7\n\nEngagement\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if we are talking about gaming companies, SVOD, AVOD, transactional- based services or a hybrid. The priority of any company after attracting a new customer is to secure its loyalty and keep it engaged to the service as long as possible, so satisfaction here plays an important role. To retain and keep your users engaged you need to make their experience on your platform as smooth as possible, make content discovery as easy as you possibly can and recommend your users exactly what they want to consume at any specific time.If they find value in your service, they\u2019ll stay. In order to offer the best customer experience, you need to fully understand your users needs and wants, track their behaviour on your platform, be able to predict their next actions and offer them an individualized experience. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can be really helpful here, to understand your users\u2019 behaviour, segment them, and predict their future actions.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n8\n\nKnowing the demographics and tastes will help you profile each user, understand their journey with your service and keep them more engaged by offering exactly what they want.\n\nThe ability to know how your users are grouped based on their engagement level, or to create clusters according to the type of content they like, the genres they usually watch or by taste communities, is also really helpful and lets you implement very specific campaigns, which allows you optimize your marketing investment by targeting only a specific cluster of users. Imagine you have a new drama series and want to approach only the drama fans that have been inactive for the past month in an attempt to re-engage them.You could just select that cluster and impact those users through, say, an emailing campaign or push notifications.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n9\n\nIf you succeed with content recommendation you can be sure that engagement levels will increase dramatically and consequently so too will the time users spend on your platform consuming content, and this in turn will lead to a greater loyalty level with your service and a higher CLTV.\nCloud-Based Workflows with AWS: Plugging in the Video Player and Video Analytics\nIn the first two parts of this series on using Bitmovin\u2019s Per-Title Encoding on AWS, we\u2019ve focused on the architecture of the application and setting up encoding using Bitmovin Cloud Connect. But now that we have our encoded videos saved to Amazon S3, what\u2019s next? In this part, I\u2019ll complete the circle by introducing Bitmovin\u2019s Video Player and Video Analytics products. I\u2019ll explain how these two tools work together, and how to use them to gather data on user interaction with your content and measure quality of service. Finally, I\u2019ll walk you through the setup that we used in our 2020 Bitmovin + AWS Hackathon to demonstrate the cost savings and performance of per-title encoding.\nWhy Do Video Analytics Matter?\nUnderstanding how your content performs is important for a few reasons. First, detailed analytics can help you improve your quality of service as in the case of Telekom Slovenjie:\n\u201cAs a customer might call in, an agent could check the types of streams the user watched, which errors they were having and on which device, and would distinguish if the error is detected on a hardline or on the actual network. With the simple analytics collector and API implementation, Telekom Slovenjiie was able to reduce their support tickets by roughly 30 percent.\u201d\nNot all video analytics providers offer as much granularity as Bitmovin. One of the big advantages of using a dedicated service for your video analytics is that you don\u2019t have to know exactly what metrics you want to track in advance. At Bitmovin, we record over forty metrics.\nThe Bitmovin dashboard is the easiest way to have a first look at your data. It breaks it down into 3 areas:\nAudience shows you how people are engaging with your content. Metrics like number of plays, unique users, ISP, location, and view time are all available here.\nQuality of Service tells you more about the user experience of your videos, which includes data like start time, bandwidth used, bitrate, etc.\nAdvertising is a must-have if you rely on advertising to fund your content, with metrics such as click-through rates, successful ad plays, and relative ad spot performance.\nThe Bitmovin Video Player\nGetting this much data from users who are streaming your videos requires to be deeply embedded in the playback sessions and therefore in the players themselves. That\u2019s where the Bitmovin Video Player comes in.\nNot only does the Bitmovin Video Player provide the widest device support for playing your videos with efficient adaptive algorithms, including with multiple codecs, and allows you to dynamically insert ads into those streams, all through a rich universal yet configurable UI, but it also contains an event-based engine that will push that rich data to the Bitmovin Analytics solution to give you that fine-grained, accurate insight into how users are watching your videos.\nProof through Video Analytics\nIn the first and second parts of this blog series, in which we described the architecture and implementation of our application, we touched only briefly on the differences between a workflow that generates a static ladder and one that generated a ladder optimized with the Per-Title algorithm. That\u2019s because those differences are small, and didn\u2019t have a material impact on the implementation.\nHowever, it is time to bring this back to the front. We are setting out to prove that Per-Title gives you significant savings when used in your production workflow, without impacting the playback experience. We can only do this through actual comparisons between different outputs encoded from the same assets.\nThere are usually two main ways in which Per-Title encoding delivers operational savings: reduced storage costs and reduced bandwidth costs.\nThe difference in storage costs is easy to calculate directly from the output of the encoding. Simply look at the difference in the total file size generated for the two encodings. The ratio between those will give you a simple and generally reliable answer. You can look at the files themselves on your Output bucket, or query the Bitmovin platform to retrieve the encoding\u2019s statistics. Since Per-Title will behave differently with different assets, it is best to take the average across a few representative assets into consideration for this calculation.\nFor bandwidth savings, it gets a bit more complicated. You could obviously look at the difference in bitrate between renditions in your 2 ladders, but there are a few complicating factors: the ladders will have a different number of renditions and different bitrates between them. And in reality, nobody streams all the renditions of your ladder at the same time. What renditions are actually played very much depends on your audience, what bandwidth they have available, what device they are playing on, etc. You can try and model this playback usage, but at the end of the day, there is no better data than real data. Enter the Bitmovin Analytics\u2026",
            "When paired with data analytics, this additional information creates a complete picture that can fully tailor the viewing experience.\n#9 Harnessing The Power of Social Media\nFurthermore, in order to properly personalize the viewing experience, OTT and TV service providers should strive to develop close relationships with their customers in order to gather feedback on their usage and learn what difficulties they can assist them with.\nAnalysis of what viewers are looking for, as well as responses to customer service issues, can all be utilized to aid decision-making.\nWhen paired with data analytics, this additional information creates a complete picture that can fully tailor the viewing experience.\nSocial media platforms have replaced text messages, but the goal remains the same: to allow viewers to connect in real time and receive immediate reaction, hence increasing engagement.\nBehind-the-scenes information, such as deleted sequences, forthcoming events, and cast and crew commentary, can all be shared on social media.\nThis gives you another way to provide delicious tidbits of information that aren\u2019t available in the core product. It\u2019s important to remember that social media is not a one-way highway; it\u2019s a terrific tool to get public input and opinions.\nOn some shows, cast members actively participate in the conversation by like and retweeting fan messages, and broadcasters urge them to do so (this can even be a carefully choreographed process).\nWhile watching a show, fans have also historically hosted virtual watch parties and shared amusing memes and gifs, a trend that has continued in recent years.\nPsst!\nDone reading the article and still confused as to how to set up the above OTT metrics?\nWe\u2019re here to help. Let\u2019s hop on to a quick call to see how we can build a robust media operation-based solution or create animated content to get your content production rolling.\nImproving Viewer Experience\nThe biggest overall goal of video analytics is understanding and predicting how customers interact with your content. Granular data analysis allows you to start making reasonable assumptions about when and how people will interact with your content in the future. Efficiently applied, that data can help you manage client expectations and establish an auditable and improvable record of service.\nThis is particularly important any time you\u2019re providing live support for customers experiencing video issues. You may have to immediately assess a client\u2019s network connection, or how long they\u2019ve been watching a video. Bitmovin\u2019s real-time video analytics platform can reduce the time your customer service team spends trying to get to the bottom of how your video is being consumed by the customer.\nRemember not everything that affects your customers is under your control. Supplemental services, like video management (eg, DRM) and advertisement management, can impact customer experience. Analytics can be particularly important in these instances because knowledge from such data is essential for managing your relationship with two stakeholders: your customer and your advertising partner. Monitoring the effect these adjacent services have on your clients helps you ensure the support they provide is positively affecting customers.\nIn addition to helping you understand where customers turn away from content, analytics can help you feed clients relevant content to keep them engaged. Granular data helps ensure you\u2019ll recommend videos customers watch start to finish rather than pushing them to videos that get interactions, but might not hold their attention.\nReducing Costs\nOne of the side effects of streaming video data is the increased importance of having the server as close to the customer as possible. As a result, video providers rely extensively on content delivery networks (CDNs). These services charge for data transferred, and video can represent a large portion of these bandwidth costs. Analyzing information like device fragmentation can enable you to directly target your user base while making efficient use of cloud-based CDNs.\nKeeping track of data like video startup time, client resolution, and percentage of time spent buffering can help you contextualize network costs, develop a cheap and efficient architecture, direct development efforts, and prevent customer churn. Flagging video quality and load time issues can prevent encoding bottlenecks before they happen. Bitmovin provides a bitrate heatmap to help understand and quantify exactly how your clients consume bandwidth. With this information, you can determine how to manage server capacity during high-traffic events, or inform a choice about adopting 4K or 8K video.\nAnalytics can help your organization look forward and plan for future requirements. As more infrastructure is hosted in cloud services, transactions incur incremental per second and per-byte costs. Optimizing services that provide discrete amounts of data millions of times over (like video) can save significant amounts of money. Analytics give you the tools to make those decisions wisely.\nInvesting in the Right Tools and Resources\nIf you\u2019re prioritizing high-definition video that\u2019s mostly consumed while users are on their phones outside the house, granular analytics will guide you to solutions like implementing codecs such as HEVC, which focuses on transmitting better quality data using smaller network connections.\nPay attention to how many users are downloading high-quality, super-fast video and how much device fragmentation affects your user block, and then apply that knowledge to weighing the stakes of investing in modern encoding innovations, like per-title encoding, multi-codec streaming, and per-scene adaptation. You can also determine what your most popular content is, then optimize the delivery of exclusively that content by providing additional encodings, targeting new users with your best material.\nGetting the Most Value Out of Your Data\nIn a nutshell, granular video analytics allow you to efficiently make decisions about how to manage the costs and effects of your video delivery infrastructure. If you provide video as a service or rely on video to convey critical content, consider integrating Bitmovin analytics. Ensure your clients aren\u2019t turned away by technical issues and be secure in the knowledge that you\u2019re making informed decisions about preparing and delivering your content.\nStart by signing up for a free trial period with Bitmovin to get a sense of the type of analytics available to you in the constantly evolving field of video content delivery.\nDid you enjoy this post?

As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability.\n\nObviously, sometimes users have to or want to leave the video service, but It is important to understand when this happens and if there is a trend. More importantly, it predicts at-risk users in advance, so retention campaigns can be launched.\n\nToday there are proven consolidated techniques to make churn management a mandatory activity, especially for video services based on a subscription business model.\n\nThere are solutions in the market like JUMP Retention, which are capable of tracking the distribution of users according to their likelihood of leaving the service in the coming months. The main variables that influence near-future churn probability for each user are also provided.\n\nAI can also be applied to improve content production and acquisition processes, which can then be used to create the content catalogue o\ufb00ered to the customer base or e\ufb00iciently license sport rights.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n8\n\nIn this area, the applications vary, depending on the video service provider\u2019s business model.\n\nFor those video service providers that traditionally license content from the major Hollywood studios, it is very important to forecast what type of content will be the most relevant for its customer base for one to two years ahead.\n\nShould I invest more in licenses for series or movies, in action or comedy, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, those service providers who produce their own content have to have an even longer forecast window. We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment. For example, JUMP Prediction today is already building predictive content consumption models that help with these decisions.\n\nAI applied to product development.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation: using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out.\n\nEvery detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n9\n\nAlso related to the product, o\ufb00ering a voice-enabled UX is unquestionably a growing trend in video services.\n\nWith voice commands in the video-on-demand service, viewers can now launch and control their viewing experience giving voice commands to devices that support technologies like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.\n\nAs an example, Accedo and Channel 4 have been working together to allow all Channel 4 viewers in the UK to start viewing content from All 4 simply by saying, \u201cOK Google, play Gogglebox\u201d. Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\nTo characterize the relationship between the network QoS and application QoS, previous works [17], [27] performed analytical studies to model the video streaming performance using TCP. An algorithm was proposed to estimate the receiver buffer requirement based on the model in [17]. Moreover, empirical studies were conducted to investigate how network conditions affect the application QoS by recording application metrics during the video playback [28], [16]. Their evalua- tions, however, were only based on Windows Media. In this paper, we adopt both analytical and empirical approaches to study the correlation between the network QoS and application QoS. In particular, we use a set of application performance metrics (APM) for the study: (1) Initial buffering time, (2) mean duration of a rebuffering event, and (3) rebuffering frequency. On the other hand, the network QoS can be mea- sured based on active measurement (e.g., OneProbe [19] and YouTube Video Speed History [2]) or passive measurement (e.g., [9], [7]).\n\nHowever, TCP throughput could be reduced by various kinds of impairments in network paths, such as packet loss and reordering. When the TCP throughput is lower than the playback rate, the video playback will pause and wait for new video data. This disruption could greatly impact the user-perceived quality, which is also known as the quality of experience (QoE). In general, the QoE can be affected by other factors, such as the quality of video and sound and the smoothness of playback, which could be cataloged into a protocol stack to form a conceptual relationship between\n\nMoreover, the QoE is usually expressed using a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of 1 (\u201cBad\u201d) to 5 (\u201cExcellent\u201d) [14]. It could be obtained from subjective or objective measurement. ITU-T Recommendation P.911 [15] provides the reference for carrying out subjective measurement of audiovisual materials, and VQEG [1] provides detailed test plans for evaluating video quality in a subjective way. However, PSNR (Peak-Signal-to- Noise-Ratio) and MSE (Mean Square Error), which are exam-\n\nthe ensuing discussion, we propose three APMs to quantify the application QoS for HTTP video streaming. We then correlate both QoS using analytical modeling and empirical evaluation.\n\nples of the objective approach, only evaluate the spatial quality of videos, therefore not suitable for HTTP video streaming. In this paper, we perform subjective experiments to evaluate how the application QoS correlates with the QoE. Based on the correlation results for the network and application QoS, we are then able to correlate the network QoS with QoE which can be effectively visualized using a radar chart [8].\n\nA. Application performance metrics\n\nWe propose three APMs to quantify the application QoS for HTTP video streaming, and these metrics represent the temporal structure of a video playback, regardless of the video content.\n\nSection II \ufb01rst highlights the related works. Section III ad- dresses the correlation between network QoS and application QoS, whereas section IV measures the correlation between QoE and application QoS. In section V, we then measure the correlation between the network QoS and QoE by combining the two sets of correlation results and use a radar chart to visualize the results. We discuss other issues which may affect the QoE in section VI and \ufb01nally conclude this paper in section VII.\n\n1. Initial buffering time (denoted by Tinit): This metric measures the period between the starting time of loading a video and the starting time of playing it.\n\n2. Mean rebuffering duration (denoted by Trebuf ): This metric measures the average duration of a rebuffering event.\n\n3. Rebuffering frequency (denoted by frebuf ): When the amount of buffered video data decreases to a low value, the playback will pause, and the player will enter into a rebuffering state. This metric measures how frequent the rebuffering events occur.\n\nII. RELATED WORK\nBYSVP, Innovation and Insights at Brightcove\nBLOG / MEDIA\nEarning trust is at the core of Brightcove\u2019s efforts to grow our leadership position in the streaming technology industry. That\u2019s why we launched QoE Analytics, a suite of features focused specifically on Quality of Experience (QoE). There\u2019s no better way to build trust with our customers than helping them monitor our performance in the arena where it matters most: the viewing experience.\nWhy Monitor QoE?\nQuality of Service (QoS) and QoE are often lumped together, which can seem like a lot for many media companies to take on, both in complexity and cost. However, they are fundamentally different. QoS focuses on key network performance metrics at an operations level, while QoE provides a sense of the viewing experience from a user perspective.\nWe believe that QoE is more meaningful and often more actionable for most media companies, given the direct correlation to user satisfaction.\nWhat QoE Metrics Are Important?\nBrightcove collects a massive amount of data on behalf of our customers. This allowed us to narrow our QoE measurements down to the ones with the most significant correlations. We then cross-checked these findings with our own research team as well as several leading media companies who have studied this carefully. Based on this, we believe the following four metrics are the most important to track over time.\n1) Video start time\nVideo start time measures the average number of seconds elapsed between the play request and the stream start. High start times correlate with abandonment before streaming even starts and can indicate issues with the CDN, player plug-ins, and initial stream bitrate where intervention makes sense. Low video start times mean your audience is watching video quickly, which is what they expect.\n2) Stall Rate\nStall rate is the average number of stalls per hour, calculated by comparing total stalls to total hours viewed in the selected time range. Unlike other rebuffering events, video stalls directly affect playback. This can manifest as single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying length. Thus, a low stall rate means smoother playback and a better viewer experience.\n3) Error Rate\nError rate is the percentage of all play requests with errors preventing playback (as opposed to background errors the viewer doesn\u2019t notice). These errors typically occur before playback begins, but they can also happen during playback. Low error rates mean that customers are usually able to watch the content they select.\n4) Upscaling Time\nUpscaling time measures the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state. Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed at a lower resolution than the playback device can display, often resulting in fuzziness or pixelation. This is particularly noticeable when a lower resolution stream is played on a large-screen device. Low upscaling time generally means your viewers are enjoying smooth, crisp video playback.\nWhile upscaling time is critical in monitoring quality of experience, there are times when it may not affect the viewer. For example, upscaling often happens when high resolution content is streamed to a 4K TV but not encoded at 4K. Since most viewers won\u2019t notice this, it\u2019s important to dig into the data to determine the reasons behind low upscaling times.\nWhat Dimensions Affect QoE?\nQoE metrics can be affected by a number of different factors, from mobile app updates to content delivery network (CDN) changes. Breaking down those metrics by different dimensions makes it easy to compare performance and identify issues and opportunities.\nDevice Type\nLooking at metrics by device category allows you to see device-specific issues and trends over time. The imaginary example below shows a spike in error rate for Android devices that could be correlated to a recent app update.\nStream Type\nBy comparing the QoE metrics of VOD against livestreams, you can isolate mode-specific issues or trends. In the fictional example below, there was a jump in upscaling around a live event that resolved quickly.\nPlayer\nLooking at QOE metrics broken out by player is a great way to isolate player-specific issues. For example, there can be significant differences in load time, depending on the plugins that load at play request. There can also be issues in specific players that result in increased error rates. Seeing these differences makes them easier to isolate and act on.\nCountry\nFor customers who operate internationally, viewing QoE metrics by country can assist in isolating regional issues. Imagine a media company adopted a new content delivery network for their Asian consumers. From the example below, it\u2019s clear that the CDN underperformed when looking at the stall rate.\nQoE Analytics in Context\nNetflix leverages machine learning to create the best media for our members. Earlier we shared the details of one of these algorithms, introduced how our platform team is evolving the media-specific machine learning ecosystem, and discussed how data from these algorithms gets stored in our annotation service.\nMuch of the ML literature focuses on model training, evaluation, and scoring. In this post, we will explore an understudied aspect of the ML lifecycle: integration of model outputs into applications.\nSpecifically, we will dive into the architecture that powers search capabilities for studio applications at Netflix. We discuss specific problems that we have solved using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, review different pain points that we addressed, and provide a technical overview of our new platform.\nAt Netflix, we aim to bring joy to our members by providing them with the opportunity to experience outstanding content. There are two components to this experience. First, we must provide the content that will bring them joy. Second, we must make it effortless and intuitive to choose from our library. We must quickly surface the most stand-out highlights from the titles available on our service in the form of images and videos in the member experience.\nHere is an example of such an asset created for one of our titles:\nThese multimedia assets, or \u201csupplemental\u201d assets, don\u2019t just come into existence. Artists and video editors must create them. We build creator tooling to enable these colleagues to focus their time and energy on creativity. Unfortunately, much of their energy goes into labor-intensive pre-work. A key opportunity is to automate these mundane tasks.\nUse case #1: Dialogue search\nDialogue is a central aspect of storytelling. One of the best ways to tell an engaging story is through the mouths of the characters. Punchy or memorable lines are a prime target for trailer editors. The manual method for identifying such lines is a watchdown (aka breakdown).\nAn editor watches the title start-to-finish, transcribes memorable words and phrases with a timecode, and retrieves the snippet later if the quote is needed. An editor can choose to do this quickly and only jot down the most memorable moments, but will have to rewatch the content if they miss something they need later. Or, they can do it thoroughly and transcribe the entire piece of content ahead of time. In the words of one of our editors:\nWatchdowns / breakdown are very repetitive and waste countless hours of creative time!\nScrubbing through hours of footage (or dozens of hours if working on a series) to find a single line of dialogue is profoundly tedious. In some cases editors need to search across many shows and manually doing it is not feasible. But what if scrubbing and transcribing dialogue is not needed at all?\nIdeally, we want to enable dialogue search that supports the following features:\nSearch across one title, a subset of titles (e.g. all dramas), or the entire catalog\nSearch by character or talent\nMultilingual search\nUse case #2: Visual search\nA picture is worth a thousand words. Visual storytelling can help make complex stories easier to understand, and as a result, deliver a more impactful message.\nArtists and video editors routinely need specific visual elements to include in artworks and trailers. They may scrub for frames, shots, or scenes of specific characters, locations, objects, events (e.g. a car chasing scene in an action movie), or attributes (e.g. a close-up shot). What if we could enable users to find visual elements using natural language?\nHere is an example of the desired output when the user searches for \u201cred race car\u201d across the entire content library.\nUse case #3: Reverse shot search\nNatural-language visual search offers editors a powerful tool. But what if they already have a shot in mind, and they want to find something that just looks similar? For instance, let\u2019s say that an editor has found a visually stunning shot of a plate of food from Chef\u2019s Table, and she\u2019s interested in finding similar shots across the entire show.\nApproach #1: on-demand batch processing\nOur first approach to surface these innovations was a tool to trigger these algorithms on-demand and on a per-show basis. We implemented a batch processing system for users to submit their requests and wait for the system to generate the output. Processing took several hours to complete. Some ML algorithms are computationally intensive. Many of the samples provided had a significant number of frames to process. A typical 1 hour video could contain over 80,000 frames!\nAfter waiting for processing, users downloaded the generated algo outputs for offline consumption. This limited pilot system greatly reduced the time spent by our users to manually analyze the content. Here is a visualization of this flow.\nApproach #2: enabling online request with pre-computation"
