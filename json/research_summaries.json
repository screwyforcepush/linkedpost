It involves analysing the text or images generated by the prompts to determine their aesthetic appeal. Mark Weiser's 1993 paper on ubiquitous computing is a key reference in this field. Yutong Xie et al. (2023) and Fred Zenker and Kristopher Kyle (2021) have conducted research on prompt engineering, and Joanna Zylinska (2020) has written a book on AI art.",
            " Prompt logs are used in text-to-image generation systems to impact the quality of the generated images. Patterns and trends in the prompt logs can lead to better or worse image generation. Research has been conducted to investigate minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices, variable length video generation from open domain textual descriptions, a large-scale prompt gallery dataset for text-to-image generative models, and design guidelines for prompt engineering text-to-image generative models.",

Specific prompts or patterns in prompt logs can lead to high aesthetic appeal images.

            "The chain of thought prompting technique is a cognitive strategy that involves guiding individuals through a series of interconnected thoughts or ideas in order to stimulate their thinking process and generate new insights or perspectives. This technique is often used in brainstorming sessions, problem-solving exercises, or creative thinking activities.\n\nThe chain of thought prompting technique typically starts with a specific question or prompt, which serves as the initial link in the chain. From there, individuals are encouraged to explore related ideas or concepts, building upon each previous link in the chain. This process helps to uncover connections, associations, and potential solutions that may not have been immediately apparent.\n\nBy following the chain of thought, individuals are able to delve deeper into a topic, consider different angles, and explore various possibilities. This technique can be particularly useful in breaking through mental blocks, encouraging divergent thinking, and fostering creativity.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique is a valuable tool for stimulating and expanding one's thinking process, allowing for the generation of new ideas and insights.",
            "The chain of thought prompting technique is a reasoning process used to solve problems or answer questions. It involves breaking down the problem or question into smaller steps and logically connecting them to arrive at a solution. \n\nIn the provided examples, the chain of thought prompting technique is used to solve various problems. In the first example, the speed of a boat in still water is determined by considering the speed of the current and the time it takes for the boat to travel a certain distance. By setting up equations and solving for the unknown variable, the speed of the boat in still water is found to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the distance covered by a car in a given time is calculated by converting the speed from km/hr to meters/second and multiplying it by the time in seconds. The distance is found to be 378.89 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the location where peanut butter can be stored is determined by reasoning that food items are usually stored in places where they can stay fresh, such as a refrigerator or a pantry. The correct answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the location where the person's friend might be waiting is reasoned by considering the context of the squash court and eliminating options that do not fit. The correct answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the desired action of people who love a place they are going on vacation is reasoned by considering the options given and selecting the one that makes the most sense. The correct answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique involves logical reasoning, problem-solving, and elimination of incorrect options to arrive at the correct answer. It can be applied to various types of problems and questions.",

The correct answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the desired action of people who love a place they are going on vacation is reasoned by considering the options given and selecting the one that makes the most sense. The correct answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the chain of thought prompting technique involves logical reasoning, problem-solving, and elimination of incorrect options to arrive at the correct answer. It can be applied to various types of problems and questions.",

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec?

We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable steps, represented as a tree structure. Each step in the tree represents a specific line of reasoning or thought process.\n\nIn the given examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to solve various problems. For instance, in the first example, the problem is to find the speed of a boat in still water. The tree of thought starts with assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr. It then considers the current of the stream (4 km/hr) and calculates the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current. By adding these two times, the total time spent traveling is found to be 2 hours. Solving for x, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the problem is to find the distance covered by a car in 14 seconds. The tree of thought involves converting the given speed of the car (96 km/hr) to meters per second and then multiplying it by the time (14 seconds) to find the distance. The final answer is determined to be 378.89 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the problem is to determine where peanut butter can be stored. The tree of thought considers that peanut butter is a food item and is usually stored in a place where it can stay fresh, such as a refrigerator or a pantry. The final answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the problem is to figure out where the person's friend might be waiting. The tree of thought considers that the person is waiting at a squash court, which suggests they are likely at a sports facility or gym. The only option that seems plausible as being at the other end of a public place is a park. Therefore, the final answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the problem is to identify what people want to do when they love a place they are going on vacation to. The tree of thought considers the given options and concludes that the only option that makes sense is staying there. Therefore, the final answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique helps break down complex problems into smaller steps, guiding the reasoning process and facilitating problem-solving. It allows for a systematic approach to analyzing and solving problems by considering different lines of thought and reasoning.",
            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes by breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps represented as a tree structure, with each step representing a specific line of reasoning or thought process. This technique is used to solve various problems by considering different lines of thought and reasoning.\n\nIn the given examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is applied to solve different problems. Each problem is broken down into a series of logical steps, represented as a tree structure. The reasoning process is explained step by step, considering different factors and options.\n\nFor example, in the problem of finding the speed of a boat in still water, the reasoning process involves assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream. The boat's travel time downcurrent and against the current is calculated, and the total time spent is equated to 2 hours. By solving the equations, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the problem of calculating the distance covered by a car in a given time, the reasoning process involves converting the speed from km/hr to meters per second and calculating the distance using the formula distance = speed * time. The distance is determined to be 378.89 meters.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by breaking down a problem into smaller steps and considering different factors and options at each step. Each step represents a specific line of reasoning or thought process. By systematically analyzing and solving each step, the overall problem can be solved.\n\nIn summary, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a problem-solving approach that breaks down complex problems into smaller steps represented as a tree structure. It allows for systematic reasoning and consideration of different factors and options. By applying this technique, problems can be solved by analyzing and solving each step of the tree structure.",

Each problem is broken down into smaller steps, and the reasoning process is explained step by step. The technique involves identifying relevant information, making logical deductions, and considering different options to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nFor example, in the first problem about the speed of a boat in still water, the technique is applied by assuming the speed of the boat as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. The problem is then broken down into two steps: the boat traveling downcurrent and the boat traveling against the current. By solving the equations derived from these steps, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second problem about the distance covered by a car in a given time, the technique is applied by converting the given speed of the car from km/hr to meters per second and calculating the distance covered in 14 seconds. The problem is broken down into several steps involving unit conversions and calculations. The final answer is determined to be 378 meters.\n\nIn the other examples, the technique is applied in a similar manner to solve problems related to storing peanut butter, waiting at a squash court, and people's desires when they love a vacation destination.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a systematic approach that breaks down complex problems into smaller steps, allowing for logical reasoning and consideration of different factors and options. It can be applied by identifying relevant information, making logical deductions, and solving each step of the problem tree to arrive at the correct answer.",
            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide reasoning and problem-solving processes. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable steps, represented as a tree structure. Each step or node in the tree represents a specific thought or action that needs to be taken to solve the problem.\n\nIn the given examples, the reasoning process is demonstrated through a series of steps that lead to the final answer. For example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the problem is broken down into calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current. By adding these two times and solving for the boat speed, the answer is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nTo apply the tree-of-thought prompting technique, one needs to analyze the problem and identify the key steps or thoughts required to reach a solution. These steps can then be organized in a hierarchical tree structure, with each step branching out into further sub-steps if necessary. By following this structured approach, individuals can systematically work through the problem and arrive at a solution.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be applied to various problem-solving scenarios, including mathematical calculations, logical reasoning, and decision-making processes. It helps individuals break down complex problems into simpler components, making it easier to understand and solve them. By providing a clear framework for thinking and problem-solving, this technique enhances cognitive processes and improves overall problem-solving skills."

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to guide the thought process and reasoning behind answering a question or solving a problem. It involves breaking down the problem into smaller components and considering different possibilities or options at each step. This technique can be used in conjunction with the chain of thought approach, which involves sequentially exploring different lines of reasoning to arrive at a solution.\n\nIn the provided examples, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to analyze and solve the given questions. The reasoning process involves considering relevant information and making logical deductions to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nFor example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to calculate the boat's speed. The process involves assuming the boat's speed in still water as x km/hr and considering the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. By calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current, and adding them together, the total time of 2 hours is obtained. Solving for x, the boat's speed in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the second question about the distance covered by a car in a given time, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is used to convert the given speed from km/hr to meters per second and calculate the distance covered in 14 seconds. By converting the speed and using the formula distance = speed * time, the distance of 378.89 meters is obtained.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by systematically analyzing the given information, breaking down the problem into smaller components, and considering different possibilities or options at each step. It involves logical reasoning and calculations to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique is a valuable approach for problem-solving and reasoning, and when used in conjunction with the chain of thought, it can help guide the thought process and lead to accurate solutions.",

The reasoning process involves considering different factors and options to arrive at the correct answer. For example, in the first question about the speed of a boat in still water, the researcher assumes the speed of the boat as x km/hr and considers the current of the stream as 4 km/hr. By calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current, and adding them up to equal 2 hours, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nSimilarly, in the second question about the distance covered by a car in 14 seconds, the researcher converts the given speed of the car from km/hr to meters per second and calculates the distance covered using the formula distance = speed * time. The distance is found to be 378.89 meters.\n\nThe tree-of-thought prompting technique can be executed by systematically analyzing the problem, considering relevant factors, and exploring different possibilities or options at each step.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The tree-of-thought prompting technique is a method used to solve reasoning-based questions by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and logically connecting them. It involves analyzing the given information, identifying relevant concepts, and applying logical reasoning to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nIn the provided examples, the technique is applied to solve various reasoning-based questions. For each question, the reasoning process is outlined step by step, showing how the given information is analyzed and logically connected to arrive at the final answer.\n\nIn the first example, the question asks for the speed of a boat in still water. The given information includes the speed of the stream and the time it takes for the boat to travel a certain distance. By assuming the speed of the boat in still water as x km/hr, the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current can be calculated. By adding these two times and solving for x, the speed of the boat in still water is determined to be 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the question asks for the distance covered by a car in a certain time. The given information includes the speed of the car and the time. By converting the units of speed and time to meters and seconds, the distance covered in 14 seconds can be calculated. The final answer is determined to be 378 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the question asks where peanut butter can be stored. By analyzing the nature of peanut butter as a food item and considering where food items are usually stored, the answer is determined to be a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the question asks where the person is waiting for their friend. By considering the context of waiting at a squash court and the options provided, the answer is determined to be a park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the question asks what people want to do when they love a place they are going on vacation to. By considering the options provided and the concept of loving a place, the answer is determined to be staying there.\n\nOverall, the tree-of-thought prompting technique involves breaking down reasoning-based questions into smaller steps and logically connecting them to arrive at the correct answer.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "The abstract provided does not directly discuss the topic of \"Unique ways to combine prompting techniques.\" However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to inform our understanding of the topic.\n\nFrom the abstract, we can gather that there are studies and research papers related to text-to-image generation systems, lexical diversity indices, AI art, and human-computer interaction. These topics may provide insights into different prompting techniques and their applications.\n\nTo further explore unique ways to combine prompting techniques, it would be beneficial to review the specific studies and research papers mentioned in the abstract, such as:\n\n- [56] \"A Prompt Log Analysis of Text-to-Image Generation Systems\" by Yutong Xie et al. This paper likely discusses different prompts used in text-to-image generation systems and their effectiveness in producing desired outputs.\n\n- [57] \"Investigating minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices\" by Fred Zenker and Kristopher Kyle. This paper may explore how different prompt lengths can impact the lexical diversity of generated text.\n\n- [58] \"AI Art: Machine Visions and Warped Dreams\" by Joanna Zylinska. This book may provide insights into the intersection of AI and art, including how prompts can be used to guide the creation of AI-generated art.\n\nBy delving into these specific sources, we can gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter and potentially identify unique ways to combine prompting techniques.",
            "The abstract provided does not directly discuss the topic of \"unique ways to combine prompting techniques.\" However, it does provide some relevant information that can be used to inform our understanding of the topic.\n\nFrom the abstract, we can gather that the research is focused on text-to-image generation systems and prompt log analysis. It mentions the use of images with high aesthetic appeal and low aesthetic appeal, as well as the exploration of minimum text lengths for lexical diversity indices.\n\nTo combine prompting techniques in a unique way, one approach could be to experiment with different combinations of prompts and analyze their effectiveness in generating high-quality and diverse images. This could involve using prompts that vary in length, style, or content, and evaluating the resulting images based on aesthetic appeal and diversity.\n\nThe application of this approach would involve conducting experiments with text-to-image generation systems, using a dataset of images with high and low aesthetic appeal. Different combinations of prompts would be used to generate images, and the resulting images would be evaluated using metrics such as aesthetic appeal and diversity. The analysis of the prompt log would provide insights into the effectiveness of different prompting techniques and help identify unique combinations that yield desirable results.\n\nOverall, the key points from the abstract suggest that combining prompting techniques in text-to-image generation systems can be explored through experimentation and analysis of prompt logs. The application of this approach involves conducting experiments with different combinations of prompts and evaluating the resulting images based on aesthetic appeal and diversity."

            "What can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability.\n\nObviously, sometimes users have to or want to leave the video service, but It is important to understand when this happens and if there is a trend. More importantly, it predicts at-risk users in advance, so retention campaigns can be launched.\n\nToday there are proven consolidated techniques to make churn management a mandatory activity, especially for video services based on a subscription business model.\n\nThere are solutions in the market like JUMP Retention, which are capable of tracking the distribution of users according to their likelihood of leaving the service in the coming months. The main variables that influence near-future churn probability for each user are also provided.\n\nAI can also be applied to improve content production and acquisition processes, which can then be used to create the content catalogue o\ufb00ered to the customer base or e\ufb00iciently license sport rights.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n8\n\nIn this area, the applications vary, depending on the video service provider\u2019s business model.\n\nFor those video service providers that traditionally license content from the major Hollywood studios, it is very important to forecast what type of content will be the most relevant for its customer base for one to two years ahead.\n\nShould I invest more in licenses for series or movies, in action or comedy, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, those service providers who produce their own content have to have an even longer forecast window. We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment. For example, JUMP Prediction today is already building predictive content consumption models that help with these decisions.\n\nAI applied to product development.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation: using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out.\n\nEvery detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n9\n\nAlso related to the product, o\ufb00ering a voice-enabled UX is unquestionably a growing trend in video services.\n\nWith voice commands in the video-on-demand service, viewers can now launch and control their viewing experience giving voice commands to devices that support technologies like Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.\n\nAs an example, Accedo and Channel 4 have been working together to allow all Channel 4 viewers in the UK to start viewing content from All 4 simply by saying, \u201cOK Google, play Gogglebox\u201d. Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns Netflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine. For years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization. As a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation. Using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out. Every detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives proven, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nNetflix also uses AI algorithms to assess each piece of content and assign it an encoding rate based on content genre, action velocity, and many other criteria that optimize the service experience depending on factors like the device used, available connectivity, etc.\n\nThere are already Hollywood studios creating customized content. 20th Century Fox, for example, has used AI to create content such as the trailer for the sci-fi movie, Morgan.\n\nUsing trailers for one hundred horror movies, Data scientists trained an AI automatic-learning algorithm to analyze the di\ufb00erent visual composition and sounds in each scene of each trailer and it was then able to understand the di\ufb00erent mechanics per version when it came time to create content of this type.\n\nAfter the algorithm was trained, it was able to analyze the 90 minutes of the movie, Morgan, and could automatically select the most appropriate scenes to include in the trailer. This task, which today normally requires at least a month of editing, was performed in 24 hours. Just imagine the future possibilities related to the production of series and long format content!\n\n5\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAnd what about the management of video services?\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, having them learn about themselves in relation to the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n!\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\n6\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nFinal Conclusion\n\nIn short, AI is not an option. Rather, to successfully compete in an ever-increasingly competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\n\n7\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nJump joins the video industry with the explicit mission to help companies maximize ROI and optimize their business decisions using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.\n\nJump was founded in 2016 by cofounders Jer\u00f3nimo Macan\u00e1s, Jes\u00fas Herrero, and John Pater who have each been working in the TV and video industry for more than a decade.\n\nOur vision is that data and its e\ufb00ective use will be the new competitive advantage in the next phase of the video industry. Nowadays only big players like Netflix, Amazon and Google use cutting- edge data technologies to compete in the video market to retain customers and increase revenues.\n\nJump is democratizing these technologies by providing a cost-e\ufb00ective Data-as-a-Service cloud platform available to all video service market players, a platform that will see your video services jump to the next level. According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Additionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, as they learn about the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n11\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nAs an example of these type of solutions JUMP Impact can automatically suggest marketing actions based on business performance KPIs. Some examples available today are:\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n\"\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons.

To successfully compete in an ever-increasing competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI. The sooner you start down the path, the sooner you will be able to identify which areas of your business are the ripest for an investment in AI-powered processes.

We all remember Netflix\u2019s success with its first in-house production (House of Cards), which was the result of using consumption forecasting techniques.\n\nFor those operators who license sports rights (TV operators, for example)\n\nbeing able to predict the fair value of media rights for a certain entertainment or sports property, for a given period and in a given geographic territory, is critical for the rights negotiation because traditionally these represent a massive investment.\n\nBy learning customer preferences and determining trends, automated learning solutions exist today that are able to propose a content mix that will maximize the ROI of the content investment.

Once the content is playing, they can then control the viewing experience by simply asking Google to pause, seek, stop, play the next episode, and so on.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n10\n\nAudience Clustering\n\nUnderstanding user behavior relationships related to engagement levels across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is key to e\ufb00ectively reach your audience with the right message, at the right time, across the right channel\n\nIdentifying relevant user engagement clusters (loyal users, sleeping users, frozen users, inactive users) and targeting marketing activities for each of them can have a significant impact on business outcomes for video services.\n\nAdditionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Netflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine. For years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization. As a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nProduct development based on empirical experimentation. Using A/B testing algorithms, di\ufb00erent product alternatives can be evaluated prior to launch allowing the product with the greatest positive impact on business objectives to be the one eventually rolled-out. Every detail, down to the creative work that accompanies each piece of content, is tested with di\ufb00erent alternatives proven, resulting in an uptake increase of up to 20%.\n\nNetflix also uses AI algorithms to assess each piece of content and assign it an encoding rate based on content genre, action velocity, and many other criteria that optimize the service experience depending on factors like the device used, available connectivity, etc.\n\nThere are already Hollywood studios creating customized content. 20th Century Fox, for example, has used AI to create content such as the trailer for the sci-fi movie, Morgan.\n\nUsing trailers for one hundred horror movies, Data scientists trained an AI automatic-learning algorithm to analyze the di\ufb00erent visual composition and sounds in each scene of each trailer and it was then able to understand the di\ufb00erent mechanics per version when it came time to create content of this type.\n\nAfter the algorithm was trained, it was able to analyze the 90 minutes of the movie, Morgan, and could automatically select the most appropriate scenes to include in the trailer. This task, which today normally requires at least a month of editing, was performed in 24 hours. Just imagine the future possibilities related to the production of series and long format content!\n\n5\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAnd what about the management of video services?\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, having them learn about themselves in relation to the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n!\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\n6\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n\"\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nFinal Conclusion\n\nIn short, AI is not an option. Rather, to successfully compete in an ever-increasingly competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nThis is only the beginning.\n\n7\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nAbout JUMP\n\nJump joins the video industry with the explicit mission to help companies maximize ROI and optimize their business decisions using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies.\n\nJump was founded in 2016 by cofounders Jer\u00f3nimo Macan\u00e1s, Jes\u00fas Herrero, and John Pater who have each been working in the TV and video industry for more than a decade.\n\nOur vision is that data and its e\ufb00ective use will be the new competitive advantage in the next phase of the video industry.

Each sharing a common trait: creating technology that can think.\n\nIn simpler terms, the science of AI studies how to make machines or computational programs intelligent and has four main objectives:\n\n1. To automate manual production processes: automated intelligence. 2. To assist with making human-performed work fast and more e\ufb00icient: assisted intelligence. 3. To help in decision-making: augmented intelligence. 4. To automate the decision-making without human intervention: autonomous intelligence.\n\nWhat industries will be a\ufb00ected by AI?\n\nAccording to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are eight key sectors where AI will most dramatically leave its fingerprint:\n\nHealth \u2022 Automotive \u2022 Financial Services \u2022 Transportation and Logistics \u2022 Technology, Communication, and Entertainment \u2022 Retail \u2022 Energy \u2022\n\nIndustry\n\n3\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nSpecifically, the PwC report indicates that there are three high potential areas for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation. 2. Personalized content creation. 3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nHow does artificial intelligence impact video service providers?\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, etc.) by investing time and money rolling-out \u201cover- the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nAll of these players face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience.

In this context, AI becomes a critical element for a video business. We\u2019d go so far as to say that survival in this sector depends on giving AI proper consideration and implementing it accordingly.\n\n4\n\nHow is artificial intelligence impacting TV and video service providers?\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start and consequently today it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, examples of which we highlight below.\n\nOne of its most valued assets is its recommendation engine.

            "Query: What are the key findings and implications of the research on \"Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data\" by Uriel Singer et al.?\n\nThe research by Uriel Singer et al. presents a method called \"Make-A-Video\" for generating videos from textual descriptions without relying on paired text-video data. The key findings of the research are as follows:\n\n1. The Make-A-Video model utilizes a two-step process: text-to-image synthesis and image-to-video synthesis. In the first step, the model generates a sequence of images based on the input text description using a text-to-image synthesis model. In the second step, the generated images are transformed into a video using an image-to-video synthesis model.\n\n2. The researchers propose a novel training approach called \"self-supervised training\" to train the Make-A-Video model. This approach leverages the temporal coherence of videos to create a self-supervised learning signal, allowing the model to learn to generate videos without the need for paired text-video data.\n\n3. The Make-A-Video model achieves competitive performance compared to existing text-to-video generation methods that rely on paired data. The generated videos exhibit coherent and meaningful visual content that aligns with the input text descriptions.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant:\n\n1. The Make-A-Video model enables video generation from textual descriptions without the need for large-scale paired text-video datasets. This reduces the data collection and annotation efforts required for training text-to-video generation models.\n\n2. The self-supervised training approach used in the Make-A-Video model can be applied to other text-to-video generation tasks, potentially expanding the applicability of text-to-video generation methods to various domains and scenarios.\n\n3. The research highlights the potential of leveraging temporal coherence in videos as a learning signal for training text-to-video generation models. This opens up new avenues for exploring self-supervised learning techniques in the field of text-to-video synthesis.\n\nIn summary, the research on \"Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data\" by Uriel Singer et al. introduces the Make-A-Video model, which can generate videos from textual descriptions without relying on paired text-video data. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of self-supervised training and highlights the potential implications of the proposed approach in the field of text-to-video synthesis.",

Therefore, without additional information or context, it is not possible to summarize the key points or provide specifics about how an AI prompting strategy works or how it can be executed.",
            "Prompts are used in AI to guide the generation of text-to-image or text-to-video systems. The abstract mentions a study on prompt log analysis of text-to-image generation systems. The study explores the use of prompts in generating images with high aesthetic appeal. The specific prompts used in the study include descriptions related to matte painting, Studio Ghibli, and trending art topics. These prompts are used to guide the AI system in generating visually appealing images.\n\nThe application of prompts in AI involves providing specific textual descriptions or instructions to guide the generation process. In the case of text-to-image systems, prompts can be used to specify the desired visual elements, styles, or themes of the generated images. The AI system then uses these prompts to generate images that align with the given instructions.\n\nTo execute the application of prompts in AI, researchers and developers need to design and train models that can understand and interpret the prompts effectively. This requires training the models on large-scale datasets that include both textual descriptions and corresponding images or videos. The models can then learn to generate visual content based on the provided prompts.\n\nOverall, prompts play a crucial role in guiding AI systems to generate specific visual content based on textual instructions. They enable the customization and control of the generated output, allowing users to specify their desired visual elements or styles."

According to PriceWaterhouseCooper\u2019s report \"Sizing the prize. What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalise?\" there are three areas of high potential for AI in the entertainment industry:\n\n1. Content search and recommendation.\n\n2. Personalized content creation.\n\n3. Personalized marketing and hyper-segmented advertising.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n4\n\nWhat can I expect from AI by using it in my video service today?\n\nLike many other industries, the end goal of AI-powered video businesses is to automate business decisions to deliver superior products and enrich the customer experience.\n\nHowever, such an ambitious goal frequently falls by the wayside if it is not properly understood. From the very start, the AI-powered activities that are deployed must have a real, positive, and measurable impact for your business.\n\nBefore outlining the AI initiatives that can be successfully delivered to video services today, let\u2019s take a moment to look back to understand where the video industry has come from, thus better understanding the momentum that is currently driving it.\n\nSince approximately 2010, the traditional players in the video and TV industry (TV broadcasters, networks, and media companies) have responded to the threats presented by the market newcomers (Netflix, Amazon, Google, Hulu, Facebook, etc.) by investing time and money rolling- out \u201cover-the-top\u201d (OTT) strategies to bypass the industry\u2019s long-established content distribution structure.\n\nIn today\u2019s industry, those traditional players that are still relevant have deployed and actively market, with varying degrees of success, video distribution platforms and content catalogues (either licensed products or developed in-house) along with di\ufb00erent business models (subscription, pay-as-you-go, advertising-based, bundled with pay-TV packages, etc.).\n\nThese players all face the same goal: to capture, retain, and engage their audience. Ultimately, they compete, not only with direct rivals from other video services, but also with the overwhelming choice o\ufb00ered to consumers by the Internet, all vying for the limited time of their users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n5\n\nIn this new, fast-changing landscape, consumers who are more and more indiscriminate and capricious will abandon your service if it does not wholly satisfy them. In this context, AI becomes an extremely helpful element for a video business.\n\nNetflix, a company that needs no introduction, has understood this from the start. Consequently, it is extremely pragmatic about the ways it applies artificial intelligence across various areas of its business, ways that could undoubtedly be of potential use to other video services, adapted to their business goals.\n\nSome of the real and proven AI-powered techniques that are potentially available to all video services are:\n\nOne of Netflix most valued assets is its recommendation engine.\n\nFor years, Netflix has been developing its own AI algorithms for content and user experience personalization.\n\nAs a result, service recommendation, in one form or another, is accredited with driving 75% of the content consumed by Netflix\u2019s users.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n6\n\nUntil recently, the integration of a content recommendation engine represented a monumental project with an equally large investment, that would have only been within the reach of the major players like Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn recent years, however, advances in big data and data science have democratized these techniques, making them available to the rest of the industry so that today the market benefits from solutions like Deep Recommender, which enables cost-e\ufb00ective and agile implementations of highly precise personalization and content recommendation solutions, like never before.\n\nIt is actually possible to make tailor-made recommendations for each video service customer by using high tech techniques like content image recognition or natural language processing, based on audience behavioral factors. Recommendations can finally be made to each individual customer based on the day of the week, time of day, or the device type that is being used when the recommendation is made.\n\nPredicting at-risk of leaving customers is crucial in order to maximize the Customer Lifetime Value of your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n7\n\nIncreasing SVOD competition and slowing OTT market growth is making customer acquisition a more challenging and expensive proposition for OTT services. As it becomes harder to win new customers, it becomes increasingly important to retain those customers who are already on your service.\n\nFor some OTT services churn is over 50%, which means it is a considerable impediment to growth and has a significant impact on OTT business profitability. Additionally, to understand user behavior relationships related to the content type watched across the user base and clustering them for segmentation purposes is a key element for your content personalization. In this sense also identifying relevant genre consumption clusters and using di\ufb00erent targeted marketing activities and service personalization can have a significant impact on video services\u2019 business outcomes.\n\nJUMP Similarity is one of the advanced analytics solutions supporting this level of automatic clustering for your entire audience.\n\nMarketing campaigns\n\nIn this domain, there is infinite potential to use AI based on automatic-learning to automatically launch campaigns personalized to each user.\n\nCurrently, it\u2019s possible to launch automatic, personalized campaigns that optimize impact depending on the audience type (specific clusters of users, with a particular churn risk, etc.), the time of day, the campaign type (engagement, retention, recapture, etc.), channel (email, push notification, social media, etc.). We can put machines to work, as they learn about the e\ufb00ectiveness of previous campaigns.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n11\n\nAutomated personalized marketing systems for video are able to recommend and automate positively impacting actions for a video service\u2019s business.\n\nAs an example of these type of solutions JUMP Impact can automatically suggest marketing actions based on business performance KPIs. Some examples available today are:\n\nSome examples:\n\nAcquisition\n\nNew user acquisition has slowed by X% in the last week.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\nEngagement\n\nLast week, user activity decreased by X%.\n\nYesterday sleeping users increased by X%.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an activation campaign\n\n\"\n\nSend push notification content recommendations\n\nRetention\n\nThere are Y # users that are about to leave your service for the following main reasons. Act or lose them!\n\n%\n\nService issues\n\n$\n\nDon\u2019t find content they might like\n\n#\n\nIn trial period with no activity\n\nRe-Capture\n\nZ # of lost users are now more willing to come back to your service.\n\n!\n\nLaunch an win back campaign\n\nThera are many other use cases available today that you wouldn\u2019t have imagined were AI-powered, and that can certainly be useful in helping you e\ufb00ectively manage your video service.\n\nWhat can Artificial Intelligence (really) do for your video business?\n\n12\n\nFinal Conclusions\n\nIn short, AI is not an option; it\u2019s a must. To successfully compete in an ever-increasing competitive market, the only options are when and how much to invest in AI. The sooner you start down the path, the sooner you will be able to identify which areas of your business are the ripest for an investment in AI-powered processes. You will then start to see the positive impact on your business.\n\nArtificial intelligence permeates almost every aspect of our lives; it certainly a\ufb00ects the way we enjoy entertainment.\n\nDon\u2019t wait.

            "Chain of Thought prompting is a technique used in language models to enable complex reasoning and improve their performance. It involves providing a series of prompts or questions to guide the model's thinking process and help it arrive at the correct answer.\n\nThe application of Chain of Thought prompting can be executed by following a step-by-step reasoning process. The model is presented with a question or problem, and it uses the provided prompts to break down the problem into smaller steps. It then reasons through each step, considering relevant information and making logical deductions. By following this chain of thought, the model is able to arrive at the correct answer.\n\nThe effectiveness of Chain of Thought prompting has been demonstrated in various studies. For example, in the paper by Zhuosheng Zhang et al., the authors propose a multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning approach that combines text and image inputs to improve language models' performance. Another study by Denny Zhou et al. explores the use of least-to-most prompting, where the model is initially provided with simpler prompts and gradually guided towards more complex reasoning.\n\nAdditional information provided in the context section includes tables and figures showing the batch sizes and accuracy of different datasets under various prompting conditions. These results demonstrate the impact of different prompting strategies, such as Correct-CoT, Wrong-CoT, Deep-CoT, and Shallow-CoT, on the model's performance.\n\nIn summary, Chain of Thought prompting is a technique used in language models to guide their reasoning process and improve their performance.

            "Chain of Thought prompting is a technique used in reasoning and problem-solving tasks. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller steps or thoughts, and then connecting them in a logical chain to arrive at a solution. This approach helps individuals organize their thoughts and systematically work through a problem.\n\nIn the given examples, Chain of Thought prompting is used to solve various problems. In the first example, the problem involves finding the speed of a boat in still water. The prompt breaks down the problem into smaller steps, considering the speed of the boat and the current of the stream. By calculating the time taken to travel downcurrent and against the current, the prompt arrives at the solution that the boat's speed in still water is 8 km/hr.\n\nIn the second example, the problem is to determine the distance covered by a car in a given time. The prompt converts the speed of the car from km/hr to meters/second and then calculates the distance covered in 14 seconds. The solution is found to be 378.89 meters.\n\nIn the third example, the prompt uses reasoning to determine where peanut butter can be stored. It considers that peanut butter is a food item and is usually stored in a place where it can stay fresh, such as a refrigerator or a pantry. The correct answer is identified as a pantry.\n\nIn the fourth example, the prompt infers the location the person is waiting for their friend based on the context of a squash court. It eliminates options that do not fit the scenario and concludes that the friend might be at the other end of a public park.\n\nIn the fifth example, the prompt analyzes what people want to do when they love a place they are going on vacation to. It considers various options and concludes that staying there is the most logical choice.\n\nOverall, Chain of Thought prompting helps individuals break down complex problems, consider relevant information, and arrive at logical solutions.

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

Final answer: D.\n\nQ: What do people want to do when they love a place that they are going on vacation in? Choices: A.pleasant thoughts B.overspending C.moving there D.staying there E.debt A: Reasoning process: 1. People want to do something when they love a place that they are going on vacation in. 2. The options given are A. pleasant thoughts, B. overspending, C. moving there, D. staying there, and E. debt. 3. Out of these options, the only one that makes sense as something people might want to do when they love a place is D. staying there. Final answer: D. Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Q: The current of a stream runs at the rate of 4 kmph. A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nWhen was the last time you did a reality check on your video marketing KPIs? If you\u2019ve been using the same benchmarks to measure success for more than a couple of years, the truth is that you\u2019re probably not getting the most out of your data.\nThe digital environment we operate in is one of constant change, driven primarily by evolving customer behaviors and expectations. This means marketers need to be on their toes, taking advantage of all the information and insights that can help them keep pace.\nWhat do customers expect? Video first. Is your team ready? Get them ready with our Video First guide.\nRead it now\nAdvancements in both available user data and a more precise understanding of what those metrics mean are helping make it possible. Amid this innovation, many common perceptions about measuring the impact of video marketing\u2014and improving it\u2014are no longer accurate.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest video marketing analytics myths to shine a light on which metrics and tools will get you the insights you need.\nMyth #1: Views are the most important metric in video marketing\nGoing viral was once upon a time seen as a golden ticket\u2014the magic moment when your brand achieved internet fame and fortune. Racking up video views was the key to making it big.\nIf that was ever truly the most valuable aspiration for a video marketer, it isn\u2019t anymore. Yes, going viral still happens, but rather than the explosive exposure it once afforded, it\u2019s more of a flash in the pan.\nReality check: Different metrics matter at different times\nVideo is a mainstay of our current digital culture. People have grown accustomed to engaging with video as entertainment, education, and part of the purchasing process.\nThat path to purchase consists of a few distinct inflection points. At each of these points, different metrics hold more weight.\nAnalytics tip: Know which metrics to watch\nWant to know what\u2019s working at each point along the path to purchase? These are the key metrics to watch for by stage.\nAwareness: While views are not the most important metric overall, there are points in time at which view totals are a valuable KPI. The awareness stage is one of those points.\nConsideration: Watch time, or engagement, is the key metric for measuring the impact your video has on viewers. Engaged audiences watch longer. If your audience is checking out at the same point in time, it might be worth recutting the video to ensure it doesn\u2019t lag and is driving quickly to what\u2019s most valuable.\nConversion: Viewing the full customer journey through touchpoint mapping can help you understand the role your video content plays in earning conversions. Interactive video is especially helpful for ROI analysis because it yields specific details about how audiences engage with your content and can drive directly to shopping carts or lead gen forms.\nRetention: Engagement data will tell you a lot about how invested customers are in your product or service. You will want to look at engagement metrics for videos that focus on training, add-ons, and upselling.\nLearn more about using metrics to measure success throughout the buyer\u2019s journey.\nMyth #2: Social media platforms provide all the analytics you need\nAh, the siren song of native video statistics, lulling marketers into believing they\u2019re sailing toward a wealth of KPIs.\nBut what are you really learning from viewing these isolated analytics? At best, you can tell how your content is performing for the audience on each specific platform, but are you really getting the full picture of reach and impact?\nReality check: Analytics viewed in isolation don\u2019t tell the whole story\nIn order to truly understand how your content performs across channels, you need to have a single view that pulls analytics from every platform where your content is published. Only then can you see how various versions of your video perform for different audiences, what works across the board, and where you\u2019re seeing the most success.\nAnalytics tip: Integrate your social data\nWhy bounce between platforms, manually extracting data and trying to make sense of it on your own, when you could simply empower a single analytics platform to do the work for you?\nBy integrating your social accounts with an enterprise-grade streaming platform, you\u2019ll be able to dig deeper into the data, do side-by-side comparisons, and discover new insights that will improve future campaign performance.\nLearn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy. BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nYou did it. You finally finished that video you\u2019ve been working on for months. Now comes the moment of truth, the moment all that hard work finally pays off. You check your video analytics: 23 views.\nWe\u2019ve all been there. As frustrating as that is, trying to get more video views can be equally aggravating. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time for a better understanding of video views.\nWhat are video views, really?\nTo product managers and engineers, video views are how many times a video is played. It means a play request was sent to the player, and the player began playing the video.\nTo marketers, video views are opportunities. They\u2019re opportunities to make potential customers aware of your brand, consider your product, and decide to shop with you. But these opportunities imply more than play requests. They assume the right audience is consuming your content.\nThe reason marketers get frustrated with video views is because that\u2019s the only metric they\u2019re tracking. Remember when pageviews used to be the primary web KPI? Marketers quickly caught on that they also needed to track metrics like bounce rate and time on page to see how their content was performing.\nTo be clear, video views aren\u2019t a bad metric. In fact, video views are fundamentally the same metric as pageviews: they both measure the number of times your content was viewed. But if you want to increase how much your content is consumed by the right people, you\u2019ll need to track other metrics.\nHow to measure video views.\nGoing viral used to be considered a legitimate marketing tactic. That is, until marketers realized that lots and lots of views from the wrong people didn\u2019t help them achieve their goals.\nTracking video views the right way means treating digital video like any other form of online content. And the same rules for measuring digital content also apply to video: you have to start at the beginning.\nMeasuring Impressions\nBefore anyone can view your content, they have to arrive at it from another channel (like clicking off an email) or within a channel (like scrolling through a social feed). When they do, that\u2019s called an impression.\nImpressions do not represent individual viewers (a single viewer can generate multiple impressions) and they do not indicate video plays or views. Whether hosted on a web page or a social post, an impression is when your video is loaded on that page or post. That\u2019s the technical definition.\nTo marketers, impressions measure how effective your video strategy is at attracting potential views. Impressions are key to tracking views because total views can only be as big as total impressions. So if you want more views, you\u2019ll need to start by getting more impressions.\nImpressions can be tracked using your CMS, the native social platform, or third-party tools like Google Analytics or HootSuite. You can also track the results of videos distributed across multiple channels in one place with platforms like Brightcove.\nMeasuring Play Rate\nAfter someone sees your video, the next step is to play it\u2014to view the content. This is where video views finally get some screen time, but even then, they\u2019re not a solo act. Play rate is the percentage of loaded videos that were actually played: total video views divided by total video impressions.\nTo marketers, play rate measures how effective your video strategy is at converting potential viewers into actual viewers. Play rate is also key to tracking views because total views are only as high as your marketing promotions are true to the video\u2019s content.\nPlay rate can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. However, not every tool automatically calculates the percentage. If you want to quickly compare videos by this metric, you\u2019ll need to export the data into a spreadsheet, build your own dashboard, or invest in a solution that does all of that for you.\nMeasuring Engagement\nTracking video views doesn\u2019t end once a viewer presses play. For a view to matter, the viewer has to consume some meaningful amount of the video\u2019s content. This is commonly referred to as engagement.\nAlso called view-through or retention rate, engagement measures how much of a video was viewed. While video views aggregate all durations (from less than a second to the entire length of the video), engagement can show you the average amount of your video that viewers watched.\nTo marketers, engagement measures how effective your video strategy is at converting actual viewers into potential or engaged customers. Engagement is key to tracking views because total views are only as valuable as the percentage of content consumed.\nEngagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number. Audience demographics.

Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "Engagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number.\nHow to increase video views.\nIncreasing video views primarily depends on serving up the right content to the right audience. You wouldn\u2019t expect a video about Roth IRAs to get a lot of views among middle schoolers.\nAssuming you have the right content for the right audience, there are several tactics that can help you increase your impressions, play rate, engagement, and ultimately your video views.\nOptimizing Impressions\nVideo impressions are not unlike search impressions. Both metrics measure how much your content resonates with your audience.\nFor example, SEO marketers optimize keywords to align with the queries of their target audience. In the same way, video marketers can pick the channels that most align with the behaviors of their target audience.\nUse display and paid social for top-of-funnel content. If your goal is awareness, you want high-volume, low-intent channels so your content can reach as far as possible.\nUse paid search or organic social for mid-funnel content. If you\u2019re targeting buyers at the consideration stage, you want medium-volume, medium-intent channels. Your content needs to reach a good-sized audience interested in specific topics.\nUse email for bottom-of-funnel content. For buyers at the decision stage, you want the best low-volume, high-intent channel. Your content needs to reach an audience that knows you, likes you, and is primed to buy.\nFollowing this paradigm will help you set expectations for your video views. Decision videos will be limited by the size of your email list, but awareness videos are only limited by the size of your budget. Once you know how many views are possible, you\u2019ll know how many to aim for and be able to identify areas of improvement.\nFor example, low impressions don\u2019t always mean you\u2019re promoting in the wrong channel. It could mean your video player isn\u2019t loading properly\u2014especially if you\u2019re using a free web player. Compare your source channel\u2019s clicks against your impressions to confirm that your player is working properly.\nOptimizing Play Rate\nPlay rate is similar to email\u2019s open rate (at least it used to be\u2014thanks, Apple). Both metrics measure how well the content matches the marketing promotions.\nJust like email marketers optimize subject lines, video marketers can employ several tactics to improve the content experience.\nSet landing page videos to autoplay. Your audience already demonstrated intent to watch by clicking off of your source channel. Don\u2019t make them click again.\nTell viewers to watch the video. Vague CTAs make play buttons optional, not the next step. They also make autoplay unwelcome.\nWrite clear copy. Don\u2019t be clever. Don\u2019t be cute. Explain your video as you would to a stranger in an elevator, not a friend at the bar. This applies to the title, description, and keywords.\nCreate custom thumbnails. Never let the player decide how to promote your video. Select the still that best represents the content, and add concise copy for channels like social.\nEven with these tactics, play rate is dependent on the situation. Homepage videos compete with lots of other content for numerous audiences of varying intent. They will never achieve the play rates of landing page videos with a dedicated email audience, especially if the latter is set to autoplay.\nWithout a doubt, the wrong copy can have just as much of an effect as the wrong content. But be sure to benchmark your play rates by video location before rewriting your campaign messaging.\nOptimizing Engagement\nVideo engagement closely mirrors social engagement. Both metrics measure whether your content was consumed.\nIn a sea of competing content creators, social marketers focus on optimizing their content to be eye-catching\u2014from custom graphics to emojis to the spacing and placement of the copy itself. Video marketers share the same opportunities to ensure their content keeps and retains their audience\u2019s attention.\nTrim your intro. Whether you forgot to set your trim points or overindulged on a title screen, a long intro is a great way to lower your engagement. Your audience is busy enough being distracted by the rest of the internet, so hurry up and get to the point.\nAdd subtitles. Subtitles not only make your content more accessible, they make it more engaging. An estimated 92% of mobile users watch video with the sound off.\nConsider interactivity. Engagement can only get so high in a lean-back experience. Adding interactivity will transform passive audiences into engaged consumers. You also won\u2019t have to wait for them to take the next step. You can put it right on top of the video. Add subtitles. Subtitles not only make your content more accessible, they make it more engaging. An estimated 92% of mobile users watch video with the sound off.\nConsider interactivity. Engagement can only get so high in a lean-back experience. Adding interactivity will transform passive audiences into engaged consumers. You also won\u2019t have to wait for them to take the next step. You can put it right on top of the video.\nLike play rate, engagement is subject to a couple different factors like length and location. Shorter videos typically have higher engagement than longer videos, so be sure to benchmark your short- and long-form content. You don't want to try to compare the engagement of a 30-minute webinar against a 30-second sizzle.\nSimilarly, videos promoted on higher-intent channels tend to have higher engagement than those promoted on lower-intent channels. You may have already found that it's hard to get social media viewers to watch much more than 30 seconds. Conversely, the majority of an email audience will probably give you up to three or four minutes of their time.\nWhy you need more than video views.\nThe whole point of a video marketing strategy is to get people to watch your videos. But just trying to increase your video views will be surprisingly disappointing. You need to measure and optimize all of the metrics related to views before you see the ones that matter increase.\nDon't be intimidated by the jargon that comes with video analytics. Video is still content, and the metrics aren\u2019t any different than the rest of digital marketing. The sooner you recognize that, the sooner you'll be able to adopt the best practices you've learned from other digital channels. You may even discover advanced strategies that also apply to video marketing. The Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n3\n\nWhen you fully understand your customer\u2019s expectations, you know that there are things that they will tolerate, like a glitch in adding content to a favorites list, but missing the game because there's a problem.... this is the kind of issue viewers don\u2019t accept and may even cause them to ask for their money back or cancel their subscription, or even churn from the service, which you definitely don\u2019t want to happen. So, when we say robust, we\u2019re talking about the ability to detect problems super-fast, and also how we handle them. Sometimes the answer is not to fix, but to to mitigate, to find a way to allow that 99.999 percent to continue viewing the content through all kinds of caching mechanisms by again, using data to understand what you want to cache and how to keep the service going even when there\u2019s a hitch in your system. Another crucial aspect is the ability to update the service. Within the whole architecture of micro services, you want to be able to roll each one out separately, if you have an issue there or you want to change something. You want to build a real Cloud TV that can scale very rapidly and fix itself if there's an issue. And then of course, there's the level of the user experience, and the speed of personalization and ability to discover content: which content you promote to your customers using all kinds of techniques, pushing the right content for each segment of users. And this is again based on a lot of data research to understand what each customer wants to do, and then knowing what content to promote. So basically, scalability, reliability and automation of the different operations, using data to achieve these three goals are in summary some of the key elements that drive today's state-of-the-art cloud TV.\n\nThe Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n4\n\nTalking now from the perspective of a direct to consumer service. Which of these variables have an impact on user experience and which ones are fundamental for growth or obstacles to growth?\n\nMoving to the customer side, every project is absolutely different from the other, people are asking for different things in each project. When we think about the technology of each project, we have different targets.\n\nThe most important thing for some sports consumers may be low latency, as it relates to betting, which has been a trending topic this last year. Other viewers may not care about latency but are looking more for stability, not having to buffer; they just want to watch the football game and have it available on different devices.\n\nYour target will determine which of these features you need to build on top or sometimes in parallel because you want to reach as many carriers as possible: the people who want to watch on their TV, those who want to watch on their iPhone\u2026 and from a marketing and business perspective you can have different subscription prices to let people watch on an iPhone or tablet, for example, but not on a bigger screen, and if they do want to watch there, they would need to spend more money. So, everything is quite connected, and you need to handle this diversity or different use to build your experience, and the perfect Cloud TV platform.\n\nWhat impact would 5G have on this?\n\nFor some years now, most media businesses have been using artificial intelligence, from the very basic setup to the most complex ones that are appearing now, because the computing resources are more powerful, and we can build on that. One of the keywords here is engagement. If you want to engage your customers, you need to recommend content and be able to be as close as possible to what they want, because what you want is your customer to stay on the sofa for a long time consuming your content, but obviously don't forget that we need good content, quality content that is not all-you-can-eat content.\n\n5G will probably give us greater stability and less buffering when using cellphones, but we are also seeing improvements to latency in broadcasting. Don't forget that sometimes you build the OTT experience on top of the broadcast and linear channels, so it's quite connected.\n\nThe Perfect Cloud TV Platform\n\n5\n\nWhat are the main challenges that customers usually face when it comes to offering the base Cloud TV platform? From ad monetization through the passive \u201clean-back\u201d experience of FAST, to OTT apps with content curated to your audience\u2019s tastes, to premium transactional offerings and pay-per-view, the way to hook viewers into your brand will be to provide the content they want regardless of how they view it, and the experience they want when they\u2019re viewing it.\nOvercoming SVOD Obstacles\nHere\u2019s the reality: we saw clearly at IBC 2022 that media businesses are learning that they must use data-driven decisions to know which audiences to reach out to and to devise strategies to nurture longer-lasting viewer loyalty. It\u2019s now clearer than ever that this isn\u2019t just a fad or a passing trend, but for long-term growth and success, subscription media businesses need to crack the audience insights code if they want to compete.",
            "BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nYou did it. You finally finished that video you\u2019ve been working on for months. Now comes the moment of truth, the moment all that hard work finally pays off. You check your video analytics: 23 views.\nWe\u2019ve all been there. As frustrating as that is, trying to get more video views can be equally aggravating. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time for a better understanding of video views.\nWhat are video views, really?\nTo product managers and engineers, video views are how many times a video is played. It means a play request was sent to the player, and the player began playing the video.\nTo marketers, video views are opportunities. They\u2019re opportunities to make potential customers aware of your brand, consider your product, and decide to shop with you. But these opportunities imply more than play requests. They assume the right audience is consuming your content.\nThe reason marketers get frustrated with video views is because that\u2019s the only metric they\u2019re tracking. Remember when pageviews used to be the primary web KPI? Marketers quickly caught on that they also needed to track metrics like bounce rate and time on page to see how their content was performing.\nTo be clear, video views aren\u2019t a bad metric. In fact, video views are fundamentally the same metric as pageviews: they both measure the number of times your content was viewed. But if you want to increase how much your content is consumed by the right people, you\u2019ll need to track other metrics.\nHow to measure video views.\nGoing viral used to be considered a legitimate marketing tactic. That is, until marketers realized that lots and lots of views from the wrong people didn\u2019t help them achieve their goals.\nTracking video views the right way means treating digital video like any other form of online content. And the same rules for measuring digital content also apply to video: you have to start at the beginning.\nMeasuring Impressions\nBefore anyone can view your content, they have to arrive at it from another channel (like clicking off an email) or within a channel (like scrolling through a social feed). When they do, that\u2019s called an impression.\nImpressions do not represent individual viewers (a single viewer can generate multiple impressions) and they do not indicate video plays or views. Whether hosted on a web page or a social post, an impression is when your video is loaded on that page or post. That\u2019s the technical definition.\nTo marketers, impressions measure how effective your video strategy is at attracting potential views. Impressions are key to tracking views because total views can only be as big as total impressions. So if you want more views, you\u2019ll need to start by getting more impressions.\nImpressions can be tracked using your CMS, the native social platform, or third-party tools like Google Analytics or HootSuite. You can also track the results of videos distributed across multiple channels in one place with platforms like Brightcove.\nMeasuring Play Rate\nAfter someone sees your video, the next step is to play it\u2014to view the content. This is where video views finally get some screen time, but even then, they\u2019re not a solo act. Play rate is the percentage of loaded videos that were actually played: total video views divided by total video impressions.\nTo marketers, play rate measures how effective your video strategy is at converting potential viewers into actual viewers. Play rate is also key to tracking views because total views are only as high as your marketing promotions are true to the video\u2019s content.\nPlay rate can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. However, not every tool automatically calculates the percentage. If you want to quickly compare videos by this metric, you\u2019ll need to export the data into a spreadsheet, build your own dashboard, or invest in a solution that does all of that for you.\nMeasuring Engagement\nTracking video views doesn\u2019t end once a viewer presses play. For a view to matter, the viewer has to consume some meaningful amount of the video\u2019s content. This is commonly referred to as engagement.\nAlso called view-through or retention rate, engagement measures how much of a video was viewed. While video views aggregate all durations (from less than a second to the entire length of the video), engagement can show you the average amount of your video that viewers watched.\nTo marketers, engagement measures how effective your video strategy is at converting actual viewers into potential or engaged customers. Engagement is key to tracking views because total views are only as valuable as the percentage of content consumed.\nEngagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number. BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nWhen was the last time you did a reality check on your video marketing KPIs? If you\u2019ve been using the same benchmarks to measure success for more than a couple of years, the truth is that you\u2019re probably not getting the most out of your data.\nThe digital environment we operate in is one of constant change, driven primarily by evolving customer behaviors and expectations. This means marketers need to be on their toes, taking advantage of all the information and insights that can help them keep pace.\nWhat do customers expect? Video first. Is your team ready? Get them ready with our Video First guide.\nRead it now\nAdvancements in both available user data and a more precise understanding of what those metrics mean are helping make it possible. Amid this innovation, many common perceptions about measuring the impact of video marketing\u2014and improving it\u2014are no longer accurate.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest video marketing analytics myths to shine a light on which metrics and tools will get you the insights you need.\nMyth #1: Views are the most important metric in video marketing\nGoing viral was once upon a time seen as a golden ticket\u2014the magic moment when your brand achieved internet fame and fortune. Racking up video views was the key to making it big.\nIf that was ever truly the most valuable aspiration for a video marketer, it isn\u2019t anymore. Yes, going viral still happens, but rather than the explosive exposure it once afforded, it\u2019s more of a flash in the pan.\nReality check: Different metrics matter at different times\nVideo is a mainstay of our current digital culture. People have grown accustomed to engaging with video as entertainment, education, and part of the purchasing process.\nThat path to purchase consists of a few distinct inflection points. At each of these points, different metrics hold more weight.\nAnalytics tip: Know which metrics to watch\nWant to know what\u2019s working at each point along the path to purchase? These are the key metrics to watch for by stage.\nAwareness: While views are not the most important metric overall, there are points in time at which view totals are a valuable KPI. The awareness stage is one of those points.\nConsideration: Watch time, or engagement, is the key metric for measuring the impact your video has on viewers. Engaged audiences watch longer. If your audience is checking out at the same point in time, it might be worth recutting the video to ensure it doesn\u2019t lag and is driving quickly to what\u2019s most valuable.\nConversion: Viewing the full customer journey through touchpoint mapping can help you understand the role your video content plays in earning conversions. Interactive video is especially helpful for ROI analysis because it yields specific details about how audiences engage with your content and can drive directly to shopping carts or lead gen forms.\nRetention: Engagement data will tell you a lot about how invested customers are in your product or service. You will want to look at engagement metrics for videos that focus on training, add-ons, and upselling.\nLearn more about using metrics to measure success throughout the buyer\u2019s journey.\nMyth #2: Social media platforms provide all the analytics you need\nAh, the siren song of native video statistics, lulling marketers into believing they\u2019re sailing toward a wealth of KPIs.\nBut what are you really learning from viewing these isolated analytics? At best, you can tell how your content is performing for the audience on each specific platform, but are you really getting the full picture of reach and impact?\nReality check: Analytics viewed in isolation don\u2019t tell the whole story\nIn order to truly understand how your content performs across channels, you need to have a single view that pulls analytics from every platform where your content is published. Only then can you see how various versions of your video perform for different audiences, what works across the board, and where you\u2019re seeing the most success.\nAnalytics tip: Integrate your social data\nWhy bounce between platforms, manually extracting data and trying to make sense of it on your own, when you could simply empower a single analytics platform to do the work for you?\nBy integrating your social accounts with an enterprise-grade streaming platform, you\u2019ll be able to dig deeper into the data, do side-by-side comparisons, and discover new insights that will improve future campaign performance.\nLearn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy. BYSVP, Innovation and Insights at Brightcove\nBLOG / MEDIA\nEarning trust is at the core of Brightcove\u2019s efforts to grow our leadership position in the streaming technology industry. That\u2019s why we launched QoE Analytics, a suite of features focused specifically on Quality of Experience (QoE). There\u2019s no better way to build trust with our customers than helping them monitor our performance in the arena where it matters most: the viewing experience.\nWhy Monitor QoE?\nQuality of Service (QoS) and QoE are often lumped together, which can seem like a lot for many media companies to take on, both in complexity and cost. However, they are fundamentally different. QoS focuses on key network performance metrics at an operations level, while QoE provides a sense of the viewing experience from a user perspective.\nWe believe that QoE is more meaningful and often more actionable for most media companies, given the direct correlation to user satisfaction.\nWhat QoE Metrics Are Important?\nBrightcove collects a massive amount of data on behalf of our customers. This allowed us to narrow our QoE measurements down to the ones with the most significant correlations. We then cross-checked these findings with our own research team as well as several leading media companies who have studied this carefully. Based on this, we believe the following four metrics are the most important to track over time.\n1) Video start time\nVideo start time measures the average number of seconds elapsed between the play request and the stream start. High start times correlate with abandonment before streaming even starts and can indicate issues with the CDN, player plug-ins, and initial stream bitrate where intervention makes sense. Low video start times mean your audience is watching video quickly, which is what they expect.\n2) Stall Rate\nStall rate is the average number of stalls per hour, calculated by comparing total stalls to total hours viewed in the selected time range. Unlike other rebuffering events, video stalls directly affect playback. This can manifest as single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying length. Thus, a low stall rate means smoother playback and a better viewer experience.\n3) Error Rate\nError rate is the percentage of all play requests with errors preventing playback (as opposed to background errors the viewer doesn\u2019t notice). These errors typically occur before playback begins, but they can also happen during playback. Low error rates mean that customers are usually able to watch the content they select.\n4) Upscaling Time\nUpscaling time measures the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state. Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed at a lower resolution than the playback device can display, often resulting in fuzziness or pixelation. This is particularly noticeable when a lower resolution stream is played on a large-screen device. Low upscaling time generally means your viewers are enjoying smooth, crisp video playback.\nWhile upscaling time is critical in monitoring quality of experience, there are times when it may not affect the viewer. For example, upscaling often happens when high resolution content is streamed to a 4K TV but not encoded at 4K. Since most viewers won\u2019t notice this, it\u2019s important to dig into the data to determine the reasons behind low upscaling times.\nWhat Dimensions Affect QoE?\nQoE metrics can be affected by a number of different factors, from mobile app updates to content delivery network (CDN) changes. Breaking down those metrics by different dimensions makes it easy to compare performance and identify issues and opportunities.\nDevice Type\nLooking at metrics by device category allows you to see device-specific issues and trends over time. The imaginary example below shows a spike in error rate for Android devices that could be correlated to a recent app update.\nStream Type\nBy comparing the QoE metrics of VOD against livestreams, you can isolate mode-specific issues or trends. In the fictional example below, there was a jump in upscaling around a live event that resolved quickly.\nPlayer\nLooking at QOE metrics broken out by player is a great way to isolate player-specific issues. For example, there can be significant differences in load time, depending on the plugins that load at play request. There can also be issues in specific players that result in increased error rates. Seeing these differences makes them easier to isolate and act on.\nCountry\nFor customers who operate internationally, viewing QoE metrics by country can assist in isolating regional issues. Imagine a media company adopted a new content delivery network for their Asian consumers. From the example below, it\u2019s clear that the CDN underperformed when looking at the stall rate.\nQoE Analytics in Context Engagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number.\nHow to increase video views.\nIncreasing video views primarily depends on serving up the right content to the right audience. You wouldn\u2019t expect a video about Roth IRAs to get a lot of views among middle schoolers.\nAssuming you have the right content for the right audience, there are several tactics that can help you increase your impressions, play rate, engagement, and ultimately your video views.\nOptimizing Impressions\nVideo impressions are not unlike search impressions. Both metrics measure how much your content resonates with your audience.\nFor example, SEO marketers optimize keywords to align with the queries of their target audience. In the same way, video marketers can pick the channels that most align with the behaviors of their target audience.\nUse display and paid social for top-of-funnel content. If your goal is awareness, you want high-volume, low-intent channels so your content can reach as far as possible.\nUse paid search or organic social for mid-funnel content. If you\u2019re targeting buyers at the consideration stage, you want medium-volume, medium-intent channels. Your content needs to reach a good-sized audience interested in specific topics.\nUse email for bottom-of-funnel content. For buyers at the decision stage, you want the best low-volume, high-intent channel. Your content needs to reach an audience that knows you, likes you, and is primed to buy.\nFollowing this paradigm will help you set expectations for your video views. Decision videos will be limited by the size of your email list, but awareness videos are only limited by the size of your budget. Once you know how many views are possible, you\u2019ll know how many to aim for and be able to identify areas of improvement.\nFor example, low impressions don\u2019t always mean you\u2019re promoting in the wrong channel. It could mean your video player isn\u2019t loading properly\u2014especially if you\u2019re using a free web player. Compare your source channel\u2019s clicks against your impressions to confirm that your player is working properly.\nOptimizing Play Rate\nPlay rate is similar to email\u2019s open rate (at least it used to be\u2014thanks, Apple). Both metrics measure how well the content matches the marketing promotions.\nJust like email marketers optimize subject lines, video marketers can employ several tactics to improve the content experience.\nSet landing page videos to autoplay. Your audience already demonstrated intent to watch by clicking off of your source channel. Don\u2019t make them click again.\nTell viewers to watch the video. Vague CTAs make play buttons optional, not the next step. They also make autoplay unwelcome.\nWrite clear copy. Don\u2019t be clever. Don\u2019t be cute. Explain your video as you would to a stranger in an elevator, not a friend at the bar. This applies to the title, description, and keywords.\nCreate custom thumbnails. Never let the player decide how to promote your video. Select the still that best represents the content, and add concise copy for channels like social.\nEven with these tactics, play rate is dependent on the situation. Homepage videos compete with lots of other content for numerous audiences of varying intent. They will never achieve the play rates of landing page videos with a dedicated email audience, especially if the latter is set to autoplay.\nWithout a doubt, the wrong copy can have just as much of an effect as the wrong content. But be sure to benchmark your play rates by video location before rewriting your campaign messaging.\nOptimizing Engagement\nVideo engagement closely mirrors social engagement. Both metrics measure whether your content was consumed.\nIn a sea of competing content creators, social marketers focus on optimizing their content to be eye-catching\u2014from custom graphics to emojis to the spacing and placement of the copy itself. Video marketers share the same opportunities to ensure their content keeps and retains their audience\u2019s attention.\nTrim your intro. Whether you forgot to set your trim points or overindulged on a title screen, a long intro is a great way to lower your engagement. Your audience is busy enough being distracted by the rest of the internet, so hurry up and get to the point.\nAdd subtitles. Subtitles not only make your content more accessible, they make it more engaging. An estimated 92% of mobile users watch video with the sound off.\nConsider interactivity. Engagement can only get so high in a lean-back experience. Adding interactivity will transform passive audiences into engaged consumers. You also won\u2019t have to wait for them to take the next step. You can put it right on top of the video.",
            "BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nYou did it. You finally finished that video you\u2019ve been working on for months. Now comes the moment of truth, the moment all that hard work finally pays off. You check your video analytics: 23 views.\nWe\u2019ve all been there. As frustrating as that is, trying to get more video views can be equally aggravating. That\u2019s why it\u2019s time for a better understanding of video views.\nWhat are video views, really?\nTo product managers and engineers, video views are how many times a video is played. It means a play request was sent to the player, and the player began playing the video.\nTo marketers, video views are opportunities. They\u2019re opportunities to make potential customers aware of your brand, consider your product, and decide to shop with you. But these opportunities imply more than play requests. They assume the right audience is consuming your content.\nThe reason marketers get frustrated with video views is because that\u2019s the only metric they\u2019re tracking. Remember when pageviews used to be the primary web KPI? Marketers quickly caught on that they also needed to track metrics like bounce rate and time on page to see how their content was performing.\nTo be clear, video views aren\u2019t a bad metric. In fact, video views are fundamentally the same metric as pageviews: they both measure the number of times your content was viewed. But if you want to increase how much your content is consumed by the right people, you\u2019ll need to track other metrics.\nHow to measure video views.\nGoing viral used to be considered a legitimate marketing tactic. That is, until marketers realized that lots and lots of views from the wrong people didn\u2019t help them achieve their goals.\nTracking video views the right way means treating digital video like any other form of online content. And the same rules for measuring digital content also apply to video: you have to start at the beginning.\nMeasuring Impressions\nBefore anyone can view your content, they have to arrive at it from another channel (like clicking off an email) or within a channel (like scrolling through a social feed). When they do, that\u2019s called an impression.\nImpressions do not represent individual viewers (a single viewer can generate multiple impressions) and they do not indicate video plays or views. Whether hosted on a web page or a social post, an impression is when your video is loaded on that page or post. That\u2019s the technical definition.\nTo marketers, impressions measure how effective your video strategy is at attracting potential views. Impressions are key to tracking views because total views can only be as big as total impressions. So if you want more views, you\u2019ll need to start by getting more impressions.\nImpressions can be tracked using your CMS, the native social platform, or third-party tools like Google Analytics or HootSuite. You can also track the results of videos distributed across multiple channels in one place with platforms like Brightcove.\nMeasuring Play Rate\nAfter someone sees your video, the next step is to play it\u2014to view the content. This is where video views finally get some screen time, but even then, they\u2019re not a solo act. Play rate is the percentage of loaded videos that were actually played: total video views divided by total video impressions.\nTo marketers, play rate measures how effective your video strategy is at converting potential viewers into actual viewers. Play rate is also key to tracking views because total views are only as high as your marketing promotions are true to the video\u2019s content.\nPlay rate can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. However, not every tool automatically calculates the percentage. If you want to quickly compare videos by this metric, you\u2019ll need to export the data into a spreadsheet, build your own dashboard, or invest in a solution that does all of that for you.\nMeasuring Engagement\nTracking video views doesn\u2019t end once a viewer presses play. For a view to matter, the viewer has to consume some meaningful amount of the video\u2019s content. This is commonly referred to as engagement.\nAlso called view-through or retention rate, engagement measures how much of a video was viewed. While video views aggregate all durations (from less than a second to the entire length of the video), engagement can show you the average amount of your video that viewers watched.\nTo marketers, engagement measures how effective your video strategy is at converting actual viewers into potential or engaged customers. Engagement is key to tracking views because total views are only as valuable as the percentage of content consumed.\nEngagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number. BYSVP, Innovation and Insights at Brightcove\nBLOG / MEDIA\nEarning trust is at the core of Brightcove\u2019s efforts to grow our leadership position in the streaming technology industry. That\u2019s why we launched QoE Analytics, a suite of features focused specifically on Quality of Experience (QoE). There\u2019s no better way to build trust with our customers than helping them monitor our performance in the arena where it matters most: the viewing experience.\nWhy Monitor QoE?\nQuality of Service (QoS) and QoE are often lumped together, which can seem like a lot for many media companies to take on, both in complexity and cost. However, they are fundamentally different. QoS focuses on key network performance metrics at an operations level, while QoE provides a sense of the viewing experience from a user perspective.\nWe believe that QoE is more meaningful and often more actionable for most media companies, given the direct correlation to user satisfaction.\nWhat QoE Metrics Are Important?\nBrightcove collects a massive amount of data on behalf of our customers. This allowed us to narrow our QoE measurements down to the ones with the most significant correlations. We then cross-checked these findings with our own research team as well as several leading media companies who have studied this carefully. Based on this, we believe the following four metrics are the most important to track over time.\n1) Video start time\nVideo start time measures the average number of seconds elapsed between the play request and the stream start. High start times correlate with abandonment before streaming even starts and can indicate issues with the CDN, player plug-ins, and initial stream bitrate where intervention makes sense. Low video start times mean your audience is watching video quickly, which is what they expect.\n2) Stall Rate\nStall rate is the average number of stalls per hour, calculated by comparing total stalls to total hours viewed in the selected time range. Unlike other rebuffering events, video stalls directly affect playback. This can manifest as single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying length. Thus, a low stall rate means smoother playback and a better viewer experience.\n3) Error Rate\nError rate is the percentage of all play requests with errors preventing playback (as opposed to background errors the viewer doesn\u2019t notice). These errors typically occur before playback begins, but they can also happen during playback. Low error rates mean that customers are usually able to watch the content they select.\n4) Upscaling Time\nUpscaling time measures the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state. Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed at a lower resolution than the playback device can display, often resulting in fuzziness or pixelation. This is particularly noticeable when a lower resolution stream is played on a large-screen device. Low upscaling time generally means your viewers are enjoying smooth, crisp video playback.\nWhile upscaling time is critical in monitoring quality of experience, there are times when it may not affect the viewer. For example, upscaling often happens when high resolution content is streamed to a 4K TV but not encoded at 4K. Since most viewers won\u2019t notice this, it\u2019s important to dig into the data to determine the reasons behind low upscaling times.\nWhat Dimensions Affect QoE?\nQoE metrics can be affected by a number of different factors, from mobile app updates to content delivery network (CDN) changes. Breaking down those metrics by different dimensions makes it easy to compare performance and identify issues and opportunities.\nDevice Type\nLooking at metrics by device category allows you to see device-specific issues and trends over time. The imaginary example below shows a spike in error rate for Android devices that could be correlated to a recent app update.\nStream Type\nBy comparing the QoE metrics of VOD against livestreams, you can isolate mode-specific issues or trends. In the fictional example below, there was a jump in upscaling around a live event that resolved quickly.\nPlayer\nLooking at QOE metrics broken out by player is a great way to isolate player-specific issues. For example, there can be significant differences in load time, depending on the plugins that load at play request. There can also be issues in specific players that result in increased error rates. Seeing these differences makes them easier to isolate and act on.\nCountry\nFor customers who operate internationally, viewing QoE metrics by country can assist in isolating regional issues. Imagine a media company adopted a new content delivery network for their Asian consumers. From the example below, it\u2019s clear that the CDN underperformed when looking at the stall rate.\nQoE Analytics in Context BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nWhen was the last time you did a reality check on your video marketing KPIs? If you\u2019ve been using the same benchmarks to measure success for more than a couple of years, the truth is that you\u2019re probably not getting the most out of your data.\nThe digital environment we operate in is one of constant change, driven primarily by evolving customer behaviors and expectations. This means marketers need to be on their toes, taking advantage of all the information and insights that can help them keep pace.\nWhat do customers expect? Video first. Is your team ready? Get them ready with our Video First guide.\nRead it now\nAdvancements in both available user data and a more precise understanding of what those metrics mean are helping make it possible. Amid this innovation, many common perceptions about measuring the impact of video marketing\u2014and improving it\u2014are no longer accurate.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest video marketing analytics myths to shine a light on which metrics and tools will get you the insights you need.\nMyth #1: Views are the most important metric in video marketing\nGoing viral was once upon a time seen as a golden ticket\u2014the magic moment when your brand achieved internet fame and fortune. Racking up video views was the key to making it big.\nIf that was ever truly the most valuable aspiration for a video marketer, it isn\u2019t anymore. Yes, going viral still happens, but rather than the explosive exposure it once afforded, it\u2019s more of a flash in the pan.\nReality check: Different metrics matter at different times\nVideo is a mainstay of our current digital culture. People have grown accustomed to engaging with video as entertainment, education, and part of the purchasing process.\nThat path to purchase consists of a few distinct inflection points. At each of these points, different metrics hold more weight.\nAnalytics tip: Know which metrics to watch\nWant to know what\u2019s working at each point along the path to purchase? These are the key metrics to watch for by stage.\nAwareness: While views are not the most important metric overall, there are points in time at which view totals are a valuable KPI. The awareness stage is one of those points.\nConsideration: Watch time, or engagement, is the key metric for measuring the impact your video has on viewers. Engaged audiences watch longer. If your audience is checking out at the same point in time, it might be worth recutting the video to ensure it doesn\u2019t lag and is driving quickly to what\u2019s most valuable.\nConversion: Viewing the full customer journey through touchpoint mapping can help you understand the role your video content plays in earning conversions. Interactive video is especially helpful for ROI analysis because it yields specific details about how audiences engage with your content and can drive directly to shopping carts or lead gen forms.\nRetention: Engagement data will tell you a lot about how invested customers are in your product or service. You will want to look at engagement metrics for videos that focus on training, add-ons, and upselling.\nLearn more about using metrics to measure success throughout the buyer\u2019s journey.\nMyth #2: Social media platforms provide all the analytics you need\nAh, the siren song of native video statistics, lulling marketers into believing they\u2019re sailing toward a wealth of KPIs.\nBut what are you really learning from viewing these isolated analytics? At best, you can tell how your content is performing for the audience on each specific platform, but are you really getting the full picture of reach and impact?\nReality check: Analytics viewed in isolation don\u2019t tell the whole story\nIn order to truly understand how your content performs across channels, you need to have a single view that pulls analytics from every platform where your content is published. Only then can you see how various versions of your video perform for different audiences, what works across the board, and where you\u2019re seeing the most success.\nAnalytics tip: Integrate your social data\nWhy bounce between platforms, manually extracting data and trying to make sense of it on your own, when you could simply empower a single analytics platform to do the work for you?\nBy integrating your social accounts with an enterprise-grade streaming platform, you\u2019ll be able to dig deeper into the data, do side-by-side comparisons, and discover new insights that will improve future campaign performance.\nLearn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy. Learn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy.\nIt\u2019s understandable that marketers struggle with their confidence in measuring ROI. Marketing is about drawing the crowd, creating the experience, and eliciting desire for what you have to offer. Not exactly easy to measure the effectiveness of a single asset that ties directly to results. But there\u2019s good news.\nReality check: It\u2019s getting a lot easier and more straightforward\nNew technologies and integrations have opened the door to richer video marketing analytics. With machine learning and AI technology powering attribution modeling, marketers can assign sales and conversions to touchpoints in conversion paths.\nWith each new data point, we gain a better understanding of how customers discover brands, engage with content, and decide to purchase.\nAnalytics tip: Link tracked behaviors to ROI\nBy integrating your streaming platform with your CRM, you can access insights that track audience behaviors throughout the full buying process, from awareness to purchase.\nSome metrics that deliver a more accurate ROI include:\nTouchpoint mapping, which shows the number and types of videos watched at different funnel stages and sequences.\nEngagement behaviors, such as dwell times, skips, and rewatches of specific sections.\nInteractive video behaviors, including in-video navigation, poll submissions, and click-through rates from video to a landing page.\nLearn more about interactive video and ROI.\nKeep current with video marketing analytics trends\nLooking for some dependable sources to stay on top of what really matters in the fast-changing world of video marketing analytics?

A boat goes 6 km and back to the starting point in 2 hours, then \ufb01nd the speed of the boat in still water? Options: A:6 B:7 C:8 D:5 E:3 A: Reasoning process: First, let\u2019s assume that the speed of the boat in still water is x km/hr. Since the current of the stream is 4 km/hr, the boat travels 6 km downcurrent in 6 km / (4 km/hr + x km/hr) hours. Similarly, the boat travels 6 km against the current in 6 km / (x km/hr - 4 km/hr) hours. Adding these two times, we \ufb01nd that the total time the boat spends traveling downcurrent and against the current is 2 hours. Solving for x, we \ufb01nd that the boat speed in still water is 8 km/hr. Final answer: C.\n\nQ: A car is running at a speed of 96kmph. What distance will it cover in 14sec? Options: A:378m B:350m C:380m D:200m E:250m A: Reasoning process: 1. We are given that the car is running at a speed of 96 km per hour. 2. We want to \ufb01nd the distance it will cover in 14 seconds. 3. We need to convert both km and hours to meters and seconds in order to compare them. 4. 1 hour has 60 minutes, 1 minute has 60 seconds, so 1 hour has 3600 seconds. 5. 1 km has 1000 meters, so 96 km have 96*1000 = 96000 meters. 6. Since we are given the speed of the car in km per hour, we need to divide the total distance in meters by the total time in seconds to \ufb01nd the distance in meters per second. 7. So, the distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is 96000 meters / 3600 seconds/hour * 14 seconds = 378.89 meters. Final answer: The distance the car will cover in 14 seconds is [A]378m.

            "BLOG / MARKETING\nMarketing\nWhen was the last time you did a reality check on your video marketing KPIs? If you\u2019ve been using the same benchmarks to measure success for more than a couple of years, the truth is that you\u2019re probably not getting the most out of your data.\nThe digital environment we operate in is one of constant change, driven primarily by evolving customer behaviors and expectations. This means marketers need to be on their toes, taking advantage of all the information and insights that can help them keep pace.\nWhat do customers expect? Video first. Is your team ready? Get them ready with our Video First guide.\nRead it now\nAdvancements in both available user data and a more precise understanding of what those metrics mean are helping make it possible. Amid this innovation, many common perceptions about measuring the impact of video marketing\u2014and improving it\u2014are no longer accurate.\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the biggest video marketing analytics myths to shine a light on which metrics and tools will get you the insights you need.\nMyth #1: Views are the most important metric in video marketing\nGoing viral was once upon a time seen as a golden ticket\u2014the magic moment when your brand achieved internet fame and fortune. Racking up video views was the key to making it big.\nIf that was ever truly the most valuable aspiration for a video marketer, it isn\u2019t anymore. Yes, going viral still happens, but rather than the explosive exposure it once afforded, it\u2019s more of a flash in the pan.\nReality check: Different metrics matter at different times\nVideo is a mainstay of our current digital culture. People have grown accustomed to engaging with video as entertainment, education, and part of the purchasing process.\nThat path to purchase consists of a few distinct inflection points. At each of these points, different metrics hold more weight.\nAnalytics tip: Know which metrics to watch\nWant to know what\u2019s working at each point along the path to purchase? These are the key metrics to watch for by stage.\nAwareness: While views are not the most important metric overall, there are points in time at which view totals are a valuable KPI. The awareness stage is one of those points.\nConsideration: Watch time, or engagement, is the key metric for measuring the impact your video has on viewers. Engaged audiences watch longer. If your audience is checking out at the same point in time, it might be worth recutting the video to ensure it doesn\u2019t lag and is driving quickly to what\u2019s most valuable.\nConversion: Viewing the full customer journey through touchpoint mapping can help you understand the role your video content plays in earning conversions. Interactive video is especially helpful for ROI analysis because it yields specific details about how audiences engage with your content and can drive directly to shopping carts or lead gen forms.\nRetention: Engagement data will tell you a lot about how invested customers are in your product or service. You will want to look at engagement metrics for videos that focus on training, add-ons, and upselling.\nLearn more about using metrics to measure success throughout the buyer\u2019s journey.\nMyth #2: Social media platforms provide all the analytics you need\nAh, the siren song of native video statistics, lulling marketers into believing they\u2019re sailing toward a wealth of KPIs.\nBut what are you really learning from viewing these isolated analytics? At best, you can tell how your content is performing for the audience on each specific platform, but are you really getting the full picture of reach and impact?\nReality check: Analytics viewed in isolation don\u2019t tell the whole story\nIn order to truly understand how your content performs across channels, you need to have a single view that pulls analytics from every platform where your content is published. Only then can you see how various versions of your video perform for different audiences, what works across the board, and where you\u2019re seeing the most success.\nAnalytics tip: Integrate your social data\nWhy bounce between platforms, manually extracting data and trying to make sense of it on your own, when you could simply empower a single analytics platform to do the work for you?\nBy integrating your social accounts with an enterprise-grade streaming platform, you\u2019ll be able to dig deeper into the data, do side-by-side comparisons, and discover new insights that will improve future campaign performance.\nLearn more about how to repurpose existing content with a strong social video strategy.\nMyth #3: Measuring video ROI is too hard\nCalculating ROI has always been a bit of a headache for marketers, but it is a necessary step. With convincing ROI data in hand, you can prove the impact of your video marketing efforts and secure future investment into your video marketing strategy.\nEngagement Status. Just like MAPs allow you to track click rates and frequency, Engagement Status lets you track viewing rates and frequency. It\u2019s a spot check on consumption behavior and can indicate viewers primed to buy and viewers at risk of disengaging.\nAttention Index. Whereas video engagement averages completion rates, Attention Index subtracts bottom engagement from top engagement\u2014ignoring the middle. The result is a better indication of how much someone will love a video, rather than letting passive viewers influence the results.\nEntertainment Index. This is the Attention Index but for individual viewers, allowing you to see what does or doesn\u2019t engage them. Combined with Engagement Status, the Entertainment Index can track viewers as they get closer to buying or disengaging.\nWith these metrics, you can create segments based on the content your audience loves.\nFor example, with Audience Insights, you can find a shared audience that has a similar Attention Index for the same videos. Better, you can see other types of videos the shared audience watched and compare their Attention Indices.\nSo not only can Audience Insights create segments based on what your customers already love, it can predict what else they\u2019ll love.\nThe whole point of personalization is to provide the content your customers want without relying on third-party data appends that violate their privacy. While most segmentations are a step in the right direction, analyzing the results is a tedious and iterative process. Audience Insights automates the analysis, allowing you to focus on creating the best content, not figuring out what that content is.\nUsing Video to Personalize Customer Acquisition\nPersonalization doesn\u2019t have to wait till your customers are on file. Third-party platforms, like Google and social media, allow you to build lookalike campaigns by uploading lists of your customers\u2019 contact information. Those platforms then match your list with other users that share similar attributes, allowing you to serve them ads for your products.\nWhile lookalike campaigns can improve customer acquisition, they can\u2019t be truly personalized without the predictive power of Audience Insights. Like CRMs and MAPs, Audience Insights can also export lists based on customer, marketing, and content data. With powerful insights like Engagement Score and Attention Index, you can create an accurate list of potential new customers while respecting their privacy.\nCommitting to Personalization and Privacy\nSetting up your marketing stack for personalization can seem complex, but it\u2019s mostly taking many of the activities you\u2019re already doing and integrating them. Sure, you can capture tons of data and integrate your CRM with your MAP. But achieving the true personalization consumers desire happens when you\u2019ve integrated your video platform and leveraged a customer data platform.\nMarketers can expect the tools and regulations around data privacy to continue to increase. Yet they\u2019ll still be tasked with providing their audiences with personalized content, communications, and experiences they demand. Combining the right technology with the right strategy, you\u2019ll be able to offer the personalization they want and the respect for their data privacy they deserve.",

            "Engagement can be tracked using your online video platform or native social platform. While most tools display this data in the form of a chart, Brightcove also provides an Engagement Score. This metric divides a video into 100 equal parts and calculates the average percentage watched per view, so you can compare videos with a single number.\nHow to increase video views.\nIncreasing video views primarily depends on serving up the right content to the right audience. You wouldn\u2019t expect a video about Roth IRAs to get a lot of views among middle schoolers.\nAssuming you have the right content for the right audience, there are several tactics that can help you increase your impressions, play rate, engagement, and ultimately your video views.\nOptimizing Impressions\nVideo impressions are not unlike search impressions. Both metrics measure how much your content resonates with your audience.\nFor example, SEO marketers optimize keywords to align with the queries of their target audience. In the same way, video marketers can pick the channels that most align with the behaviors of their target audience.\nUse display and paid social for top-of-funnel content. If your goal is awareness, you want high-volume, low-intent channels so your content can reach as far as possible.\nUse paid search or organic social for mid-funnel content. If you\u2019re targeting buyers at the consideration stage, you want medium-volume, medium-intent channels. Your content needs to reach a good-sized audience interested in specific topics.\nUse email for bottom-of-funnel content. For buyers at the decision stage, you want the best low-volume, high-intent channel. Your content needs to reach an audience that knows you, likes you, and is primed to buy.\nFollowing this paradigm will help you set expectations for your video views. Decision videos will be limited by the size of your email list, but awareness videos are only limited by the size of your budget. Once you know how many views are possible, you\u2019ll know how many to aim for and be able to identify areas of improvement.\nFor example, low impressions don\u2019t always mean you\u2019re promoting in the wrong channel. It could mean your video player isn\u2019t loading properly\u2014especially if you\u2019re using a free web player. Compare your source channel\u2019s clicks against your impressions to confirm that your player is working properly.\nOptimizing Play Rate\nPlay rate is similar to email\u2019s open rate (at least it used to be\u2014thanks, Apple). Both metrics measure how well the content matches the marketing promotions.\nJust like email marketers optimize subject lines, video marketers can employ several tactics to improve the content experience.\nSet landing page videos to autoplay. Your audience already demonstrated intent to watch by clicking off of your source channel. Don\u2019t make them click again.\nTell viewers to watch the video. Vague CTAs make play buttons optional, not the next step. They also make autoplay unwelcome.\nWrite clear copy. Don\u2019t be clever. Don\u2019t be cute. Explain your video as you would to a stranger in an elevator, not a friend at the bar. This applies to the title, description, and keywords.\nCreate custom thumbnails. Never let the player decide how to promote your video. Select the still that best represents the content, and add concise copy for channels like social.\nEven with these tactics, play rate is dependent on the situation. Homepage videos compete with lots of other content for numerous audiences of varying intent. They will never achieve the play rates of landing page videos with a dedicated email audience, especially if the latter is set to autoplay.\nWithout a doubt, the wrong copy can have just as much of an effect as the wrong content. But be sure to benchmark your play rates by video location before rewriting your campaign messaging.\nOptimizing Engagement\nVideo engagement closely mirrors social engagement. Both metrics measure whether your content was consumed.\nIn a sea of competing content creators, social marketers focus on optimizing their content to be eye-catching\u2014from custom graphics to emojis to the spacing and placement of the copy itself. Video marketers share the same opportunities to ensure their content keeps and retains their audience\u2019s attention.\nTrim your intro. Whether you forgot to set your trim points or overindulged on a title screen, a long intro is a great way to lower your engagement. Your audience is busy enough being distracted by the rest of the internet, so hurry up and get to the point.\nAdd subtitles. Subtitles not only make your content more accessible, they make it more engaging. An estimated 92% of mobile users watch video with the sound off.\nConsider interactivity. Engagement can only get so high in a lean-back experience. Adding interactivity will transform passive audiences into engaged consumers. You also won\u2019t have to wait for them to take the next step. You can put it right on top of the video.\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n9\n\nIf you succeed with content recommendation you can be sure that engagement levels will increase dramatically and consequently so too will the time users spend on your platform consuming content, and this in turn will lead to a greater loyalty level with your service and a higher CLTV.\n\nKnowing which content performs the best - or worst- and which content providers are the most successful can also help you optimize your investment in content.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n10\n\nThis deep understanding of your video service user\u2019s data will assist you in providing them a personalized experience. ML and AI let you offer contextual recommendations for your users tailored to their consumption habits and personalized recommendations adapted to the different user consumption scenarios to increase user satisfaction and engagement.\n\nJump predictions help you boost acquisitions by using predictions to identify the most likely candidates to convert to paying customers and lets you leverage AI models to predict the trial users that are most likely to convert, thus defining a solid conversion strategy with immediate, concrete actions.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n11\n\nRetention\n\nEngaged customers will turn into higher CLTV and this will have a direct impact on a company\u2019s ROI, so customer retention is fundamental for any company and again, knowing exactly what your users want and how they behave in your video service is crucial to predicting when they are most likely to leave your service. User journey should be accurately tracked, to optimize the overall UX performance of your service:\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n12\n\nThere are many drivers for churn but the good news is that with Jump predictions you can measure the KPIs that put your users at risk and impact them before it\u2019s too late! You can increase retention by understanding why your users would leave, and before they leave by leveraging specific AI models to predict churn and understand why customers might be at risk, leading you to a retention strategy with defined concrete actions.\n\nChurn is predictable and the precise knowledge of our users lets us accurately predict when they are more likely to leave, so that we can reverse the situation, get them to stay and increase CLTV.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n13\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion we can say that service discovery, acquisition performance, audience engagement, service monetization, churn analysis and many other behavioral metrics, taken altogether (as it wouldn\u2019t make sense to base business decisions on any one metric) will help your OTT business jump to the next level by using data smartly to understand your user base, predict user behaviour, enhance the effectiveness of your marketing activities and as a result optimize customer acquisition, retention, and engagement.\n\nThe smart use of data can help you build your business model around better conversion rates to make trial acquisition efficient and marketing pay off, by finding the patterns that lead to success.\n\nThere are definitely pretty interesting ways to tie data together to do something unique, and then tie that to audience metrics and behavioral patterns to fine- tune how you recommend content in an effective way and engage users to increase conversion rates and lifetime value.\n\nML and the Use of Smart Data to Attract, Acquire & Retain Subscribers in OTT\n\n14\n\nAbout Jump\n\nJump joined the media and entertainment industry in 2016 with the explicit mission to champion business optimization, using Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies to ramp up video businesses\u2019 ROI.
