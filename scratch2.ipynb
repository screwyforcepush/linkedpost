By the time you’ve finished next year’s budget and developed your H1 plans, the holidays are upon you. When are you supposed to have time to research future trends that could impact your business?\\nThe answer is right now. At Brightcove, we’re always keeping an eye on the changes in the market with a potential effect on our customers. Whether you’re in media, marketing, or communications, below are the trends we expect to change how you do business. If you want to learn how to incorporate them into your plans for next year, start streaming PLAY Season 1.\\nMedia Company Instincts\\nHow do you implement these trends? Watch PLAY Season 1 to find out.\\nIn 2007, a marketing research firm estimated that a person living in a city was exposed to up to 5,000 ad messages a day. Compared to 2,000 ads per day 30 years prior, one can only imagine how many ads each of us see today.\\nAll of this content has resulted in more than wearying the consumer (nearly 70% of adults worldwide actively avoid ads, according to eMarketer). It’s wearying marketers.\\nIf your target audience is consuming several thousand ads a day—let alone other content—how are you supposed to reach them? It’s hard enough to stand out among that much content. It’s even harder when most are trying to avoid your efforts in the first place.\\nMarketers are just as frustrated with all the noise as consumers are. Attention is at a premium, and the current best practices and tactics just aren’t cutting it. It’s time for a new approach. It’s time to act like a media company.\\nMedia companies learned the secrets to retaining audience attention long ago, and they did that through video. If you want to grow your business, you need to follow the example set by the media giants and embrace the power of streaming.\\nLearn more in our PLAY episode, “Why Every Company Needs to Act Like a Media Company”.\\nAdaptive Codec Switching\\nRemember film cameras? There was a time when no one thought digital cameras would ever be able to compete. The data and storage needed were too great for a consumer device. And that was just for stills, not video.\\nLook at how far we’ve come. Digital cameras are taking billboard-sized photos. Smartphones are making Oscar-contending films. Even 4K video can be streamed almost anywhere in the world without a cable.\\nIndeed, many of us have come to expect the same level of visual fidelity on our phones as we do on big screens. But all of our technological advancements haven’t changed the fact that streaming high-quality content involves an immense amount of data.\\nDelivering content that meets viewers’ increasingly high expectations isn’t cheap. In fact, the cost of streaming often means that scaling up your business will require you to scale down your quality. In an age where quality is a selling point, growing your business is quickly becoming a catch-22.\\nBandwidth costs aren’t coming down anytime soon, so waiting out the market isn’t an option. If you want to scale your business without compromising the quality your viewers expect, you’ll need to invest in adaptive codec switching.\\nFor many years, delivery costs were the same for every customer, regardless of their available bandwidth. But why should you pay to deliver 4K video to every customer when many lack the bandwidth to stream it? With adaptive codec switching, you don’t have to.\\nLearn more in our PLAY episode, “High Quality Video vs Reducing your Bandwidth Costs”.\\nFirst-Party Data\\nIn 1994, digital marketing was changed forever.\\nWebsites were growing rapidly, email was beginning to take off, and social media was still in the future. During these formative years, one simple innovation would lay the groundwork for what would become a $600 billion industry: the third-party cookie.\\nUnlike traditional marketing tactics, cookies turned advertising into a precision instrument.\\nRenting billboards was costly, buying media was competitive, and neither of them guaranteed visibility with the targeted audience. Cookies allowed marketers to track customer behavior with such granularity that CPMs were soon overshadowed by the remarkable efficiency of PPC.\\nFor years, digital marketers enjoyed bidding for clicks down to the penny, and the future of marketing never seemed more certain. But we already know how this story ends. And we should be grateful for it.\\nThird-party cookies may have spoiled us with pristine ROAS projections, but they also made us lose sight of their original function. Cookies were supposed to help us serve our customers better by helping us understand them and their needs better.\\nWe don’t need to mourn the death of the cookie; we need to celebrate the refocus on customer relationships.\\nWith first-party data, we have a chance to increase both our value to our customers and their value to us. And with the depth of detail provided by video data, that value will never be clearer.\\nLearn more in our PLAY episode, “Don’t Bury it—Use it—First Party Data Management”.\\nQuality of Experience\\nWhat do users experience when they view your content? Does the video start quickly? Does the picture look crisp and clear? Is the video playing smoothly?\\nAll of these questions impact users’ perceptions of your content and their likelihood to return in the future. Understanding your users’ quality of experience (QoE) and when it might require intervention is a key element to growing and maintaining an audience.\\nStreaming platforms should be working relentlessly to ensure that the QoE they provide is great. But they should also provide more insight into this, beyond a general feeling that it “just works,” as one of our customers recently quipped.\\nSubjective customer experiences are hard to define and identify. However, research-based, objective criteria can be used to both understand QoE and recognize when it affects the business.\\nRemember, not every service improvement or issue has a noticeable effect on the customer experience. This means that customer engagement and retention can’t be reliably correlated to Quality of Service (QoS). It’s much easier and more effective to correlate a customer’s experience with their satisfaction.\\nThe great news is that QoE doesn't have to rely on ad hoc customer observations. Streaming solutions offer an abundance of data that can be aggregated to give you a picture of the overall customer experience. All you need are the tools and expertise to harness that data and transform it into actionable insights.\\nLearn more in our PLAY episode, “Quality of Experience and Its Impact on Your Business”.\", 'metadata': {'source': 'https://www.brightcove.com/en/resources/blog/video-streaming-trends/'}}, page_content=\"BLOG / BRIGHTCOVE NEWS\\nBrightcove News\\nNo quarter of the year moves faster than Q4.

       " Document(lc_kwargs={'page_content': 'BYSVP, Innovation and Insights at Brightcove\\nBLOG / MEDIA\\nEarning trust is at the core of Brightcove’s efforts to grow our leadership position in the streaming technology industry. That’s why we launched QoE Analytics, a suite of features focused specifically on Quality of Experience (QoE). There’s no better way to build trust with our customers than helping them monitor our performance in the arena where it matters most: the viewing experience.\\nWhy Monitor QoE?\\nQuality of Service (QoS) and QoE are often lumped together, which can seem like a lot for many media companies to take on, both in complexity and cost. However, they are fundamentally different. QoS focuses on key network performance metrics at an operations level, while QoE provides a sense of the viewing experience from a user perspective.\\nWe believe that QoE is more meaningful and often more actionable for most media companies, given the direct correlation to user satisfaction.\\nWhat QoE Metrics Are Important?\\nBrightcove collects a massive amount of data on behalf of our customers. This allowed us to narrow our QoE measurements down to the ones with the most significant correlations. We then cross-checked these findings with our own research team as well as several leading media companies who have studied this carefully. Based on this, we believe the following four metrics are the most important to track over time.\\n1) Video start time\\nVideo start time measures the average number of seconds elapsed between the play request and the stream start. High start times correlate with abandonment before streaming even starts and can indicate issues with the CDN, player plug-ins, and initial stream bitrate where intervention makes sense. Low video start times mean your audience is watching video quickly, which is what they expect.\\n2) Stall Rate\\nStall rate is the average number of stalls per hour, calculated by comparing total stalls to total hours viewed in the selected time range. Unlike other rebuffering events, video stalls directly affect playback. This can manifest as single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying length. Thus, a low stall rate means smoother playback and a better viewer experience.\\n3) Error Rate\\nError rate is the percentage of all play requests with errors preventing playback (as opposed to background errors the viewer doesn’t notice). These errors typically occur before playback begins, but they can also happen during playback. Low error rates mean that customers are usually able to watch the content they select.\\n4) Upscaling Time\\nUpscaling time measures the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state. Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed at a lower resolution than the playback device can display, often resulting in fuzziness or pixelation. This is particularly noticeable when a lower resolution stream is played on a large-screen device. Low upscaling time generally means your viewers are enjoying smooth, crisp video playback.\\nWhile upscaling time is critical in monitoring quality of experience, there are times when it may not affect the viewer. For example, upscaling often happens when high resolution content is streamed to a 4K TV but not encoded at 4K. Since most viewers won’t notice this, it’s important to dig into the data to determine the reasons behind low upscaling times.\\nWhat Dimensions Affect QoE?\\nQoE metrics can be affected by a number of different factors, from mobile app updates to content delivery network (CDN) changes. Breaking down those metrics by different dimensions makes it easy to compare performance and identify issues and opportunities.\\nDevice Type\\nLooking at metrics by device category allows you to see device-specific issues and trends over time. The imaginary example below shows a spike in error rate for Android devices that could be correlated to a recent app update.\\nStream Type\\nBy comparing the QoE metrics of VOD against livestreams, you can isolate mode-specific issues or trends. In the fictional example below, there was a jump in upscaling around a live event that resolved quickly.\\nPlayer\\nLooking at QOE metrics broken out by player is a great way to isolate player-specific issues. For example, there can be significant differences in load time, depending on the plugins that load at play request. There can also be issues in specific players that result in increased error rates. Seeing these differences makes them easier to isolate and act on.\\nCountry\\nFor customers who operate internationally, viewing QoE metrics by country can assist in isolating regional issues. Imagine a media company adopted a new content delivery network for their Asian consumers. From the example below, it’s clear that the CDN underperformed when looking at the stall rate.\\nQoE Analytics in Context\\nTo properly track trends, it’s also important to see metrics and dimensions in context with each other. For example, Brightcove’s QoE solution not only provides charts for each metric, it includes a table with all metrics for a more comprehensive view. In addition to the key metrics, it also includes view count, video resolution breakdown, rebuffering time, and average bitrate for additional context.\\nThe table is sortable by any of the columns and responsive to dimension selection, making it easy to explore and identify outliers. In the fictional example below, the device dimension was selected.\\nQuality of Experience You Can Trust\\nOn most days, Quality of Experience reporting will be a testament to the high quality video streaming that Brightcove is known for. However, issues can arise and we want to ensure that we’re helping our customers see them. This is a big step forward in our mission to be the most trusted streaming technology company in the world.', 'metadata': {'source': 'https://www.brightcove.com/en/resources/blog/qoe-actionable-video-streaming/'}}, page_content='BYSVP, Innovation and Insights at Brightcove\\nBLOG / MEDIA\\nEarning trust is at the core of Brightcove’s efforts to grow our leadership position in the streaming technology industry.
